1. **Short** introduction passage.
2. **Medium** chunk on modeling habits.
3. **Short** chunk on properties of habits
4. **Super short** chunk on habit statistics.
5. **Very long** chunk on techniques.
6. **Super short** tldr;
7. **Super short** conclusion.

Throughout this essay, stars (*) will denote papers in the citation list at the end, and daggers (†) will represent footnotes, which are also found at the end, before the citations.

# **Introduction:**

People, as the saying goes, are  creatures of habit. Many of our actions every day are repeated often, typically without much thought. 

This type of thoughtlessness, though, isn’t necessarily bad. Habits can help reduce cognitive load, allowing us to get through the day. Imagine trying to weigh the pros and cons of flushing the toilet every time! Making in-depth, reasoned decisions  all the time can be very costly in terms of both time and attention. Habits allow us to compartmentalize certain behaviors so that our energy and focus can be better directed.

A 2002 study where university students were asked to write down their hourly tasks found that around 40% of daily activities were habitual (defined as regularly performed at the same time and location) *1.

My goal here is two-fold: one is to give an overview of the mechanisms behind habits,  and two is to give evidence-backed concrete techniques to affect them.

# **A Habit Model:**

There are many definitions of habits which all try to triangulate the term in different ways. The model we'll be working with here, which is often overlapped in these definitions is this: a habit is an automatic behavior that is cued by  context from the situation *4 †1.

Habits can be thought of as your default responses to different situations. This model for habits is composed of two parts: the **context cue** and the **response**.

HABITS IMAGE STANDARD MODEL

The **context cue**, also called the “trigger” or “situation”, is what first kicks off the entire process. Context cues are typically external things in the environment, from people to sensory details to preceding actions.

Once the cue occurs, the response is generated.

The **response**, also  called the “action”, is the behavior that follows the cue. Responses are typically small, atomic actions, but there is also some research suggesting that a series of actions can be “chunked” together into a unit that follows from the response *5.

However, note that actions which require more thought and conscious effort don’t become habitual, even when repeated in the same context *6. Thus, I’ll be recommending simpler responses when we get to creating our own habits.

This [Context cue] → [Response] model is a core way think about habits.

While this model might seem obvious or simplistic, I think it also allows for much of what we intuitively label as “habits” to fit  this template of [Context cue] → [Response]. Here are some examples:

1. Ring! Your alarm shakes you awake. In response, your arm slaps the alarm, hitting the Snooze button, and you go back to sleep.
    **[Context cue]** Shrill sound of alarm going off.
    **[Response]** Turn it off and go back to sleep.

2. "Hey!" Someone asks you “How are you doing?” and you instantly respond with “Good, you?”
    **[Context cue]** The words “How are are you doing?”
    **[Response]** Immediately saying “Good, you?”

3. Beep beep! You open the car door and get inside. After stepping into the car, your hands are already looking for the seatbelt.
    **[Context cue]** Opening the car door.
    **[Response]** Putting on the seatbelt.

This model is important in that it stresses how much of our behavior *isn’t* directly under our control. It highlights how habits can be seen as a way of outsourcing our behavior to the environment. There’s a very real sense in which the central point of control shifts from *internal* to *external*.

What does the process for habit formation look like? We'll go through an example with flossing:

1. Perform an action that isn’t too complex.
    EX: You floss your teeth.

2. Keep performing the action in a stable context.
    EX: You floss your teeth after brushing.

3. Your brain begins to make associations between the context when the action is performed and the action itself.
    EX: Something in the brain does something.

4. Continue performing the behavior frequently in the context.
    EX: You keep up this flossing habit after you brush your teeth and do it often.

5. Over time, the entire habit loop becomes internalized and largely automatic.
    EX: You end up with a flossing habit.

Much of the actual complexity is in  Step 3, where our brains are able to somehow store the information about both the context cue and response together. How are habits actually stored in the brain? One suggested mechanism for how this actually happens is motivated cuing *7. 

Motivated cuing claims that certain cues can cause us to act because we anticipate a reward as a result of our actions. Thus, the cue itself brings to mind a sense of “desiredness” which leads us to act.

A good example is notifications on  Facebook. Many people might feel a nagging draw to click on the red notification button as soon as they see it, like a sort of mental itch  they need to scratch. There’s a two-step phenomenon here, something like [See Facebook notification] -> [Click on it].

Motivated cuing says that this is  because past experience with the cue (i.e. the red notification icon)  has led to rewards (i.e. information about online activity that involves you). This means that one way habits could come about is by triggering a motivation to act when we experience *just* the situation itself (even if the accompanying reward hasn’t shown up yet).

Okay, so this seems plausible. How do we know if something like this is actually happening in the brain? One piece of evidence is a classic study involving monkeys and juice.

Here’s what happened: We started with some monkeys, some juice, and a light. We trained the monkeys to push a lever when they saw the light flash, which would then reward them with  the juice. When the monkeys received juice, we saw a spike of brain activity (as we might have expected).

Eventually, though, we saw the monkeys’ brain activity shift. Rather than spiking when they received the juice, we began to see the spike when they merely saw the light. In other words, the monkeys seemed to react to the context cue that signaled the reward rather than the reward itself *8.

However, I think the motivated cuing model alone is unsatisfactory for several reasons. Many of our routines don’t always have well-defined rewards, like folding laundry or drying off with a towel. Additionally, as we’ll see in the next section, rewards seem to have an overall negative effect on habit formation.

An alternative model, direct cuing, has also been proposed *7. Direct cuing suggests that when we perform the same  actions often enough, one after another, a link will form between them.

For example, consistently putting on  the seatbelt after getting into the car can lead to an association  forming as we chunk the two actions in our brains, one after another. Thus, once we get into the car, our next automatic step is to look for  the seatbelt. Other simple actions are things like tying our shoelaces right after we put on our shoes or using the same  conversation starters (EX: “Have you seen anything good lately?”) with the same friend again and again.

In direct cuing, the most important consideration is repetition.
