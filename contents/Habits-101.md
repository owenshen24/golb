# **Introduction:**

People, as the saying goes, are creatures of habit. Many of our actions every day are repeated often, typically without much thought.  A 2002 study where university students were asked to write down their hourly tasks found that around 40% of daily activities were habitual (defined as regularly performed at the same time and location) *1.

Many people have habits they wish to start or habits they wish to break. My goal here is three-fold: 

1. Give an overview of the mechanisms/models behind habits.
2. Clarify what is/isn't a habit, and when we have leverage to affect habits.
3. Explain several evidence-backed concrete techniques to create/break habits.

# **A Habit Model:**

There are many definitions of habits which all try to triangulate the term in different ways. The model we'll be working with here, which is often overlapped in these definitions is this: a habit is an automatic behavior that is cued by context from the situation *4 †1.

Habits can be thought of as your default responses to different situations. This model for habits is composed of two parts: the **context cue** and the **response**.

HABITS IMAGE STANDARD MODEL

The **context cue**, also called the “trigger” or “situation”, is what first kicks off the entire process. Context cues are typically external things in the environment, from people to sensory details to preceding actions.

Once the cue occurs, the response is generated.

The **response**, also called the “action”, is the behavior that follows the cue. Responses are typically small, atomic actions, but there is also some research suggesting that a series of actions can be “chunked” together into a unit that follows from the response *5.

However, note that actions which require more thought and conscious effort don’t become habitual, even when repeated in the same context *6. Thus, I’ll be recommending simpler responses when we get to creating our own habits.

This [Context cue] → [Response] model is a core way think about habits.

While this model might seem obvious or simplistic, I think it also allows for much of what we intuitively label as “habits” to fit this template of [Context cue] → [Response]. Here are some examples:

1. Ring! Your alarm shakes you awake. In response, your arm slaps the alarm, hitting the Snooze button, and you go back to sleep.
    **[Context cue]** Shrill sound of alarm going off.
    **[Response]** Turn it off and go back to sleep.

2. "Hey!" Someone asks you “How are you doing?” and you instantly respond with “Good, you?”
    **[Context cue]** The words “How are are you doing?”
    **[Response]** Immediately saying “Good, you?”

3. Beep beep! You open the car door and get inside. After stepping into the car, your hands are already looking for the seatbelt.
    **[Context cue]** Opening the car door.
    **[Response]** Putting on the seatbelt.

This model is important in that it stresses how much of our behavior *isn’t* directly under our control. It highlights how habits can be seen as a way of outsourcing our behavior to the environment. There’s a very real sense in which the central point of control shifts from *internal* to *external*.

Much of the actual complexity is in figuring out how brains are able to somehow store the information about both the context cue and response together. How are habits actually stored in the brain? One suggested mechanism for how this actually happens is motivated cuing *7. 

Motivated cuing claims that certain cues can cause us to act because we anticipate a reward as a result of our actions. Thus, the cue itself brings to mind a sense of “desiredness” which leads us to act.

A good example is notifications on Facebook. Many people might feel a nagging draw to click on the red notification button as soon as they see it, like a sort of mental itch they need to scratch. There’s a two-step phenomenon here, something like [See Facebook notification] -> [Click on it].

Motivated cuing says that this is because past experience with the cue (i.e. the red notification icon) has led to rewards (i.e. information about online activity that involves you). This means that one way habits could come about is by triggering a motivation to act when we experience *just* the situation itself (even if the accompanying reward hasn’t shown up yet).

Okay, so this seems plausible. How do we know if something like this is actually happening in the brain? One piece of evidence is a classic study involving monkeys and juice.

Here’s what happened: We started with some monkeys, some juice, and a light. We trained the monkeys to push a lever when they saw the light flash, which would then reward them with the juice. When the monkeys received juice, we saw a spike of brain activity (as we might have expected).

Eventually, though, we saw the monkeys’ brain activity shift. Rather than spiking when they received the juice, we began to see the spike when they merely saw the light. In other words, the monkeys seemed to react to the context cue that signaled the reward rather than the reward itself *8.

However, I think the motivated cuing model alone is unsatisfactory for several reasons. Many of our routines don’t always have well-defined rewards, like folding laundry or drying off with a towel. Additionally, as we’ll see in the next section, rewards seem to have an overall negative effect on habit formation.

Cognitive scientists will also talk about direct cuing as an alternative explanation for how these associations are made, but all "direct cuing" means is that associations get made without needing an accompanying goal state *7. It also doesn't provide a very mechanistic explanation, so I'll stop the discussion here.

# Habit Properties

Apart from the standard habit model, there are a few other useful properties to keep in mind about habits. We’ll be going over how habits are insensitive to reward changes, independent of intentions, and automatic defaults.

## **Insensitivity to Reward Changes:**

One property of habits is that they are largely insensitive to reward changes, meaning the habit persists even when the rewards are altered or removed *10. One study looked at people cued to press a button for a food reward; yet, even when the reward was removed, we saw that they continued to respond by pressing the button *11. 

This gives some insight into why using only rewards and incentives usually isn’t enough to change your habits. Once you’ve internalized the habit loop, changes to the outcome don’t have much effect on altering your behavior. This might seem counterintuitive. Surely people are more likely to act on certain behaviors if you pay them, right?

Well, we do see that financial incentives, as one example of a reward, actually *are* often good at encouraging short-term activities. Compared to a control group, we see that people who receive incentives are more likely to perform the target behavior. But once the rewards stop, the behavior often does *not* habituate *12. For example, a recent study with over 1,000 subjects examined whether paying people to go to the gym would lead to increased gym habits. We found that about two months after the payment stopped, the increase in behavioral frequency went back down to roughly pre-incentive levels *13.

Lastly, we often see that drug addicts continue to use substances, even when such behavior turns self-destructive †2. This sort of behavior has also been replicated in animal studies, where rats continue to respond habitually to stimuli, even when the incentive is changed to a disincentive (EX: a poison) *14.

The takeaway here is that simply changing rewards isn’t enough to create or break habits.

## **Independence of Intentions:**

A common dichotomy for behavior is that between “goal-directed actions” and “habitual actions”.

Our intentions, i.e. our desires and thoughts, do a good job of predicting which goal-directed behaviors we’ll carry out. Goal-directed behavior refers to the category of actions where we act consciously on our preferences.

On the flip side, habitual behavior is quicker and largely unaffected by rewards, as we covered above *15. They are largely independent of intentions, meaning that they persist even if you don't want to continue the behavior.

(Such a view has many parallels to other dual-process theories like System 1 and System 2, popularized by Daniel Kahneman in his book *Thinking Fast and Slow*.)

In the earlier example with drug use, for example, it’s quite plausible to assume that the addict would have liked to stop due to the negative effects of continued use, but still found it hard to quit. We see that one’s intentions only affect behavior when the habit is weak. For example, people’s intentions to purchase fast food only affected their actual purchases in the absence of a strong habit *16. When habits become well-developed, intentions matter little.

IMAGE OF HABIT STRENGTH AND TIME

On the flip side, several studies have shown that in new, unfamiliar contexts, our habits become disrupted, and our intentions once again become a stronger guide to behavior *17. We’ll formalize this dynamic later in the form of a technique called Cue Disruption in to help with creating and breaking habits.

Thus, there’s a sort of inverse relationship here between one’s intentions and one’s habits. When habits are not well-established, intentions are a strong determinant of behavior. When habits *are* well-established, intentions become irrelevant *18.

The important takeaway here is that simply “intending” to change your habits *isn’t enough*.

## **Automatic Defaults:**

The last important property of habits is their automaticity. As alluded to earlier, habits operate without much conscious control. Though they might be deliberately overridden, they are what we default to in the absence of cognitive effort. Indeed, we see that when people become distracted, their habits take over, even in situations where a more reasoned decision might have been optimal *19 †3. For example, driving to

This also helps explain why rewards don’t do much to influence habitual behavior: Incentives often work best when they are deliberately considered, but the automatic nature of habits means that they occur without much deliberation. Thus habits (due to their automaticity) can be thought to bypass the explicit consideration process (which is also where rewards hold the greatest weight).

The automaticity of habits is a double-edged sword:

If we’re not careful, habits can show up when we don’t want them to. These are referred to as “action slips”, and common examples are situations like driving along the same route to one’s workplace on a Sunday or calling people “Dad” (even when they aren’t your father) *18. On the other hand, sometimes, the best performance in an art or sport comes from this automaticity. For example, in a basketball game, there’s little time to think over every shot; good form and accuracy must be automatic.

## Base Rates

To avoid getting any unrealistic expectations on how long it’ll take to start seeing results, we can also turn to some empirical studies.

One study of around 100 people going to the gym found that about half of the people developed habits in about 40-50 days *21. An earlier study using a different methodology (and a smaller pool of people) found that the individual times varied very greatly, but the average time worked to be about 66 days *22.

CALENDAR IMAGE

Thus, for a conservative estimate, you want to scale your expectations to something in the ballpark of about two months. That’s a long-ish time. Probably longer than what most people naively estimate, I think. Also, in the second study, we found that only about half of the people even formed habits at all. This means the 66 day figure only came from the people who even succeeded in the first place.

This also means that if you tried to start a habit right now, your chances of sticking with a habit would only be about 50%.

My hope is that these evidence-backed techniques detailed below can bump you past the base rate.

# Creating Habits

As we touched upon in an earlier section, the process by which habits form, when simplified, looks roughly something like this:

1. **Figure out what you want to do.**
2. **Identify the situation where you want the action to occur.**
3. **Actually perform said action in said situation.**
4. **Repeat the [Context cue → Response] loop until habituation occurs.**

Therefore, from a theoretical standpoint, a useful intervention would try to affect at least one of the above steps. The three evidence-backed techniques we’ll go over are **Trigger Action Plans (TAPs)**, **Systematic Planning**, and **Scaling Up**.

Often, the best results occur when they’re all used in tandem, as they each affect different steps of habit formation.

## Trigger Action Plans (TAPs):

*[TAPs are a way of framing intentional habit creation by focusing on both a salient trigger (i.e. context cue) and an action (i.e. response). They are well-backed by over two decades of research and build off the standard habit model.]*

### Research:

Trigger Action Planning is a technique by the[ Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR)](http://www.rationality.org/) that is an adaptation of the **implementation intention** technique by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer. Implementation intentions are also known as “if-then plans” because they take the form of a conditional, not unlike those used in programming, where one thing follows another. Basically it’s a way of chaining together actions and situations.

In writing, it roughly looks like:

> “I intend to do action X when I encounter situation Y.”

As an example, a typical implementation intention for eating healthier might look like: “I intend to fill up half my plate with veggies whenever I am at a self-serve restaurant.”

Compared to many other behavioral change interventions, implementation have a stronger evidence base, and they’re simple to put into practice. In a meta-analysis of over 90 studies involving implementation intentions, we found that they “had a positive effect of medium‐to‐large magnitude ([effect size] = 0.65) on goal attainment” *23. 

Thus, as one would expect, research that shows people who make implementation intentions have a far higher success rate of achieving their target behavior compared to people who merely hold normal intentions (EX: “I intend to do X”) *24. CFAR’s Trigger Action Plan model builds on the implementation intention model and tailors it to the standard habit model, focusing on selecting concrete context cues and specific actions †4.

### Technique:

TAPs combine what we know about the standard habit model of a context cue paired with a response with the if-then nature of implementation intentions.

Trigger Action Planning has us specify specifically *when* and *how* we’d like to behave via a Trigger and an Action. It deliberately utilizes the same process that our habits naturally arise, allowing us to intentionally create new habits.

 A TAP takes the form of:

 When **[Trigger X]** happens, I will perform **[Action Y]**. Schematically, it’s almost identical to the implementation intention setup. But the TAP model stresses a few different factors.

TAP IMAGE

Here is how to think about TAPs step-by-step:

1.  **Identify an Action you want to do.**
    *  EX: “Go jogging more.”
2.  **Find a concrete sensory Trigger for the situation where you want the action to happen.**
    *  EX: “The feeling of the coarse rope that opens my curtains in the morning.”
3.  **Describe the Action you’d like to perform, in detail. Be specific about the action you’d like to.**
    *  EX: “Pick up my jogging shoes and walk outside the door to begin jogging.”
4.  **Put the Trigger and Action in a “When [Trigger], then [Action]” loop.**
    *  EX: “When [I feel the rough coarseness of my curtain rope,] then [I’ll go grab my jogging shoes and open the front door].”
5.  **Write the TAP down somewhere you can find it again.**
    *  EX: Having a digital or physical “TAPs List” document can be a very strong way to make it easy to review which habits you’re currently training. If you end up forgetting the cue or action, then it’s obvious you won’t be able to practice the behavior.
6.  **Mentally rehearse the TAP at least 5 times.**
    *  EX: *Actually* take the several minutes to do some visualizations—going over it in your mind helps you recognize the Triggers when they show up in the real world.

Specificity and concreteness are very useful here because a more salient cue is easier to recognize. Thus, for any TAP, the best Triggers are the ones that are a clear sensory sensation you can recognize. You don’t have to be limited by external cues, though; this can also be applied to internal sensations if you’re noticing them.

As an example, if you’re trying to avoid snapping at someone when they irritate you, you can try to break down the feelings right after they speak. Maybe it feels like a tightening in your chest, or a sinking feeling in your stomach. The important thing here is to describe the internal feeling with enough detail such that you can recognize it the next time it happens.

Questions to perhaps ask yourself are “Where in my body do I feel the sensation?” and “What does the sensation feel like it’s doing inside?”

Good places to insert TAPs are at the end of existing routines, a procedure called piggybacking. We see that people who put their implementation intentions at the end of habits they already have, like deciding to floss right after brushing, are more successful *25. TAPs can themselves be the Trigger for future TAPs!

The most important thing is that both the Trigger and Action are specific enough such that you just do it without thinking. Vaguely-specified Actions are not as good as well-quantified ones because you need to spend time trying to remember what it means.

For example, say we have this TAP:

**Trigger:** “When I finish a reading an online article…”

→

**Action:** “then I will summarize it.”

Both the Trigger and Action could be made more specific. Going into more detail, a perhaps improved version of the above might look like:

**Trigger:** “When I click the red ‘X’ to close a window after reading an online article…”

→

**Action:** “then I will set a 5 minute timer. For the next 5 minutes, I’ll type out a summary of what I just read on Microsoft Word.”

I think the second formulation is better because it’s more specific about what the Trigger is, and it also unpacks the word “summarize” by turning it into a more concrete set of actions. Oftentimes, like above, it can be good enough to let the Action part of your TAP be the start of a longer action chain.

Above, the 5 minute timer is merely a way to get started. After the 5 minutes are up, you can continue writing your summary, especially if you find yourself in the middle of something interesting.

Likewise, in the earlier exercising example, the Action simply has you go through the front door. But once that happens, the TAP doesn’t need to worry about describing the actual jogging; once you’re outside, the rest of your body can take over.

For both of these examples, TAPs are used as a way to simply get started in the first place.

In terms of habits, TAPs help you get started on things you *already wanted to do*, but might otherwise have forgotten. They’re a type of reminder of sorts. You’ll typically want to use them on things that you would feel driven to do *if* you had the opportunity to act on them in the first place.
