title: Meta-Advice

Advice is when people, uh, advise you to do a thing which (they think) will be helpful for you. Sometimes it's a very specific thing in particular (e.g. giving firm handshakes), and other times it's a more general thing (e.g. being "assertive" during negotiations). In either case, I think advice can be abstracted into telling someone to act a certain way, in a certain class of situations. There's the expectation of repeated behavior.

Good advice is when people tell you stuff which has the effect of actually causing you to do the thing. **[Link to Good Self-Help is Self-Defeating]**. Note that this might not involve telling you outright, "Hey, you should do this thing X." They might instead tell a personal story of how they benefited from doing X, which changes your intuitions about how useful X is. Or they might cite some study. It seems like many people value insights they discover on their own more than insights other people tell them, which then affects how much they'll actually act on the insight. To that end, good advice encourages curiosity and independence about this whole self-help business.

Meta-advice is when people tell you stuff about how you should treat stuff other people tell you, in order to make it more helpful (or so they think). 



1. In Defense of the Obvious
	1. Rejecting the immediate gut response
	2. Reasons why obvious advice is good
2. Pushing for Practicality
	1. If the point of advice is to act on it, how might you act on it?
	2. Asking questions about usability, examples
3. Analogous Expectations
	1. Mental skills are procedural, not declarative
	2. Sports, other skills
	3. Operationalizing, avoiding conceptual pitfalls
4. Q: What sort of advice does the above meta-advice select for/against?
	1. For: Advice with actionable components, things that you can do.
	2. Against: Advice that's about mindset changes, things about intuitions.
