	2. Reasons why obvious advice is good
2. Pushing for Practicality

	2. Asking questions about usability, examples
3. Analogous Expectations
	1. Mental skills are procedural, not declarative
	2. Sports, other skills
	3. Operationalizing, avoiding conceptual pitfalls
4. Q: What sort of advice does the above meta-advice select for/against?
	1. For: Advice with actionable components, things that you can do.
