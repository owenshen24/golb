title: Recognizing vs Generating

In computer science, one of the biggest open questions concerns [P vs NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem). This question asks whether or not problems that are quickly *verifiable* are also quickly *solvable*. For example, checking to see whether 7 and 17 are prime factors of 119 versus actually factoring 119. This dichotomy isn't just academic in nature; it also provides a good starting point for what I regard as the human analogue of this dichotomy--**Recognizing** vs **Generating**.

In short, Recognizing tasks rely on your brain's ability to quickly recognize patterns. Generating tasks rely on your brain's ability to put pieces together. Here is an example of what I want to point to:

Say you have an outline, and an essay that was written using the outline as a guide. 

You give both items to your friend. "Can you match up the outline to the essay?" you ask. Here, their goal is to see which bullet points on the outline were expanded into different sentences and paragraphs. It's not too difficult of a task.

This is a Recognizing task.

Now, say you give only the the outline to your friend. "Can you use this outline to write an essay?" you ask. Note the difficulty jump. Here, their goal is to actually expand on the bullet points into full sentences and paragraphs, whereas you previously only had to cross-reference. 

This is a Generating task.

The difference between these two is like matching up vocabulary words to their definitions versus filling in the definitions yourself. The Recognizing task gives you something to work with, whereas the Generating task requires you to start from scratch. Both are related, but in the above example, it's easy to see that the two aren't the same thing. 

The difference isn't always so clear-cut. Here's another example:

A student is reading their textbook, studying for their math exam. They go over the proof in their book. "Does this step make sense?" they ask themselves. They make sure they can follow what's going on before moving to the next step.

This is a Recognizing task.

Now, consider a second student who has the same exam. After reading the textbook, the student closes the textbook and thinks back to the proof. "How did that proof go, again?" they ask themselves. Starting with a blank page, they derive each step. At each step, rather than just following along, they're asking themselves what they need to show next to get to the end of the proof.

This is a Generating task.

When people think about "studying for math", I think both the Recognizing and the Generating task can jump to mind as correct things to do. Indeed, for most conventional uses of the word "lazy", you wouldn't fault the first student as being lazy. Yet, there is a specific type of effort lacking from the first student's approach. Indeed, only the second student's approach is going to help when the test asks for proofs from scratch.

But here, as in many other Recognizing vs Generating dichotomies, it can be easy to trick ourselves into thinking we're putting in more effort than we really are. "After all," the tempting thought goes, "both reading the textbook and writing proofs count as 'studying', so why can't the easier one work?"

Some part of us believes that we can do the easier Recognizing task, yet still reap the greater benefits of the Generating task. 

In everyday life, I think this is why math can end up being a difficult subject for many people. It’s all too easy to fool yourself that you understand what's going on when you’re just following along with the textbook. Cover up the steps, though, and try to solve the problem yourself, and things get a lot harder.

In a similar vein, when you’re reading a book and the author says, “Now, obviously, we can conclude X,” this is a sign to pause. You should take a step back and examine what you actually think. If the author hadn’t presented you with the conclusion, could you have generated it with the pieces you already had?

Overall, this substitution is a clear-cut example of mixing up [concept space and action space](./Concept-Space-vs-Action-Space.html). We think that just because the tasks are conceptually similar, they must also have similar effects. But this intuitive notion of porting over similarities in other categorical domains is a flawed one. 

For humans, I hope I've made the case that Recognizing tasks (i.e. P) are easier than Generating tasks (i.e. NP). As such, if you think that humans are apt to bias towards less effortful options, you'd expect to see many more instances of Recognizing, even if Generating is what produces more useful work.

And indeed, I think this is true. 

For example, in a group discussion, you’ve probably never had a shortage of people willing to critique ideas that get proposed, but it's less often that you have many people willing to share lots of ideas. From an effort perspective, that makes sense: it’s far easier to point out why an idea is bad (after all, basically every plan will have drawbacks!) than to come up with ideas in the first place. This isn’t to say that criticism isn’t important, but I do think it’s important to acknowledge this asymmetry in effort that’s being put in by both sides.

One takeaway here might be to offer up more ideas early, even if you think they're bad, because criticism will arise anyway. Better to offer your group a wider selection of ideas (and have them improved by criticism) than to hold it in.

For self-help specifically, I think that there is a tendency for advice to get cached as [declarative knowledge, rather than procedural knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge), in a way which parallels the Recognizing vs Generating dichotomy. Briefly, declarative knowledge refers to things you know how to *relate*, like Paris being the capital of France. Procedural knowledge refers to things you know how to *do*, like tying a knot. The issue is that most models in self-help appear to be declarative, but their efficacy lies in their being procedural.

To give a more concrete example: When you first learn about the planning fallacy, this involves concepts together. You learn that the planning fallacy is a cognitive bias, it revolves around underestimation, and that reference class forecasting is a way to help. You learn that reference class forecasting is a method of creating estimations, that it's been successful in public works projects, and that it requires choosing your reference class carefully.

At the end of all of this, you might have a mind map that looks something like this: 

(INSERT PICTURE HERE)

And this is all well and good, if the purpose of learning about the planning fallacy was to do well on an undergraduate psychology exam. You will be able to answer questions like "Does the planning fallacy say we systematically overestimate or underestimate?" or "What does reference class forecasting do?"

This extends to other areas like motivation, habits, procrastination, meditation, etc. where, after learning / research, you can build a detailed internal representation of the concept and its related nodes. But this usually isn't what you want! What you want is to be able to put all those concepts into practice, so they actually become useful. This requires finding examples of using the concept and thinking of ways to integrate the concept into your existing schedule.

If building a mental map is the Recognizing task, then finding ways to actually have the concepts cash out into actions is the Generating task. And once again, it's harder. In the same way that you get good at tying your shoes by doing it again and again (with feedback), you get better at reference class forecasting by doing it again and again. 

This provides strong motivation for a meta-self-help framework that often endorses just *doing the thing*, whatever that thing in question is.

I'll end with one last extended example:
"The best way to get a thought into someone's head might not be explicitly trying to describe that thought."
Ditto for motivating actions.

* advice-giving example

Lastly, a more general example of this Recognize vs Generate distinction has to do with coming up with ideas. If you’ve ever been in a group discussion, you’ve probably never had a shortage of people willing to critique ideas that are proposed. But having a steady stream of ideas proves to be harder.

Once again, I think the distinction is at work here. It’s far more easier to point out why an idea is bad (after all, basically every plan will have drawbacks!) than to come up with ideas in the first place. This isn’t to say that criticism isn’t important, but I do think it’s important to acknowledge this asymmetry in effort that’s being put in by both sides.

I think that one of the most useful ways to use this distinction is when people give advice. 

I claim that basically everyone who gives advice is doing it wrong.

The tldr; is that I think that pretty much all advice people give falls into the Recognizable category, when they should really be thinking in a more Generating style.

Here’s what I think roughly goes into people’s heads when they try to give advice into another human:

1. Think of several experiences where things turned out well for them. 
EX: “That time I won the free laptop, that time I scored the awesome job, and that time that I asked Andy to the dance.”

2. Try to find some common threads between all of the experiences. 
EX: “Well, I did always start with a good impression, I always introduced myself well in all of those times…”

3. Distill it into something general. Give it out as advice.
EX: “Remember to always start with a strong handshake!”

So your experienced friend, hoping to impart some worldly advice, tells you to always start with a strong handshake. And that advice promptly gets filed under your “Boring Advice” drawer in your head, never to be seen again.

I think that the core problem here is that your friend hasn’t done a good job of accurately conveying the reasons for the advice given.

From inside their heads, they have access to all of their experiences, so once they’ve got the generalized piece of advice—”Remember to always start with a strong handshake!”—which they can check against their memories to verify if it’s a good match.

They’re able to quickly recognize that the advice checks out.

But, for you, the advice-getter, you don’t have access to any of those experiences. 

So the best you, the advice-getter, can do is imagine a few situations where the advice kinda works out, and it’s not at all as convincing and obviously “good” as the advice-giver thinks it is.

I think that advice becomes far better when you start taking a Generative approach towards things.

Now, instead of looking for common threads, you ask yourself, “What information would I have needed in those situations in order to have come up with those positive actions in the first place?” 

Rather than checking to see if your outcomes match the advice you give, you’re now actually checking to see if the advice you give even leads to those outcomes in the first place. 

Which is great because it better aligns your thinking with that of the advice-getter’s. It means you’re thinking about what they do and don’t know. Which means you’re less likely to fall prey to the illusion of transparency, the cognitive bias where we assume that everything we know is also known by the other party.

There’s a certain sense here where you’re modeling humans as complicated input-output machines, and you’re trying to see what sort of input would generate the best outputs. 

If we turn this back to the handshake example, an attempt to be more Generative might look like this:

Your helpful friend tells you, “Hey, so whenever you meet someone, you should definitely check out the hills and valley of their hand. It’s totally groovy!”

Now, your curiosity is piqued. The next time you meet another human, you squeeze their hand, trying to figure out where the hills and valleys are. To your surprise, they respond, “Hey, nice handshake!” and the rest of the meeting goes swimmingly well.

As a result, you think to yourself, “Gee, it turns out that handshakes are pretty great when they’re firm!”

This is undoubtedly a silly toy example. 

But I hope it illustrates how a large part of advice is letting the other person figure out the actual advice for themselves.

Of course, note that the dichotomy goes both ways: If you’re receiving advice from someone that your brain is quickly labeling as “obvious”, it’s a good idea to do a check and see if you could have come up with it yourself if they hadn’t told you.

And I don’t mean to imply that this model is the only or best way of giving advice. 

There’s certainly other ways, from going meta (EX: acknowledging that the advice sounds boring and/or obvious), finding ways to quickly shift intuitions (EX: telling a memorable anecdote), to bridging the differences in experience (EX: give more background information).

But I think that the Recognize vs Generate distinction is still a highly useful one that can find itself into many more discussions. 

In general, taking note of this dichotomy means we want to avoid the surface-level similarities of what, at their very core, are quite different activities (i.e. recognizing vs generating). 

The obvious takeaway is that the effort required for the two tasks is very different, despite their apparent similarities. The slightly deeper one is thinking in a more input-output style where you’re trying to imagine fitting pieces together to get the end result.
