title: The Best Self-Help Is Self-Defeating
summary: Self-help is supposed to get people to stop needing it. But the typical incentives in any medium mean that it's possible to get people hooked on your content, rather than learning from it.

### IN-PROGRESS ESSAY. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.

So here's a proverb we've likely heard a variant of many times before: "Give a person a fish, feed them for a day. Teach them to fish, feed them for a lifetime."

Taken at face value, the proverb says that it's important to teach people self-sufficiency, rather than to give them one-time aid. Dive a little deeper, and there's a discussion about local vs systemic solutions. In medicine, for example, it's popular to debate "curing the cause" versus "alleviating the symptoms." While such a dichotomy might arguably be mistaken for medicine, I think this is an apt framing for self-help. Indeed, the above proverb could be seen as about giving people advice such that they become self-sufficient.

In this essay, I'm curious about what that process of becoming self-sufficient looks like. It seems there's a self-defeating dynamic where we do a thing such that we (later) don't have to keep doing the thing. If we squint a little, I think the same dynamic occurs in other areas of learning/improvement.

Here are some more examples of what I'm pointing to:

1. Using an abacus to do math so that you can stop using the abacus and just use your mind.
2. Reading a programming textbook so you can stop referring to the book and write programs of your own.
3. Using training wheels on your bike so you can stop using them later on.

In all of the above examples, there's something of a crutch (i.e. abacus, textbook, training wheels) that we might rely on for a while, but the intent is to slowly wean ourselves off of the crutch. In the end, we should be able to go on our own. 

Likewise, if we're trying to do self-help right, we want people to be able to “graduate” from our mental models and figure out what actually works for them. We want to catalyze people to find their own optimal solutions instead of consisting coming back to us for more help every time. We want them to go off on their own adventures in life, confident that they have the ability to craft new tools when the ones you give them stop working. We want to make ourselves obsolete.

The [Recognize vs Generate dichotomy](https://mlu.red/recognizing-vs-generating) comes into play here. From the outside, following advice someone else gave you can look about the same as coming up with something similar on your own. But being the sort of person who can generate solutions independently is far more effective in the long run.

Okay, so we've basically just said that the whole point of self-help is to help people help themselves. Not that controversial a viewpoint. The real problem comes in when we consider the way that self-help gets publicized and published.

First off, consider the incentives of media like newspapers, television, comics, or novels. Growing an audience is an explicit part of their goals; their profits are largely tied to their viewership. As a result, it makes a lot of sense for them to come out with constant content—it keeps the original crowd coming back for more, and it presents ample opportunity to draw new people in.

Self-help, as we've described above, ideally follows a different set of incentives. For your audience, the goal is self-sufficiency. Entertainment is not your goal, so you don’t really want people binging on your content. You want them to read the content, learn whatever lessons are useful for them, and then move on. 

Which means that some sort of constant, fluctuating, or even decreasing number of readers can actually be a sign that you’re doing things correctly.

This stark conflict between typical media incentives for publicity and the lofty goals of self-help hits at the heart of the issue. I think that most people in the self-improvement space (save Cal Newport) have gone way off into the “maximize profits and publicity” direction instead of the “maximize beneficial impact of the content” direction. 

Here’s a hypothetical situation: Someone with genuinely altruistic motivations might want to first write some clickbaity articles to bring in an audience, and then provide more real insights. 

“I’ll just do the clickbait stuff first, and then I’ll gradually transition to deeper stuff later,” they think, "That way, after I build an audience, I can gradually bring insights to the masses."

Except that they never transition. Writing to nab in readers begets more writing designed to nab in more readers. Unfortunate as that might be, it's also understandable. None of this self-help stuff is happening in a vacuum. Battles for attention in the modern world are zero-sum, and the other side (i.e. all other media) is already optimizing the hell out of [grabbing your attention](http://www.tristanharris.com/2016/05/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds%e2%80%8a-%e2%80%8afrom-a-magician-and-googles-design-ethicist/). 

The above scenario is definitely a caricature, but it seems like a plausible way for well-intentioned people to get stuck writing bad stuff. And I'm definitely not accusing self-help writers of being evil masterminds who write addictive content under the guise of self-improvement in order to make profits. 

Rather, I just think that throughout the normal course of writing self-help content, writers will just have to make certain decisions which trade off the direct benefit of content.

One obvious example is the choice in media format: Books are self-contained and seem to stand at one end of an axis which has Twitter tweets and Facebook posts on the other. For books, feedback from the reader is far less immediate (worse for the author), and the payoff to the reader is far less instant (worse for the reader). As you go from one end to the other, you’re trading off conceptual complexity for audience reach.

There are also subtler things. For example, consider these design choices:

1. Removing infinite scroll on your blog.
2. Removing suggested posts after one post is done.
3. Batching notifications for comments.

These are all ways to reduce addictiveness on the web, which are probably in your readers’ best interests. At the same time, most of those choices will also reduce traffic on your site as a whole. 

It’s not just media format or design choices:

When you think you have good content, you’re going to want to share it to others. After all, the only way that self-help materials can help others is if people read them in the first place. Unfortunately, most ways to get more people interested and spread your content involve increasing the level of memetic stickiness and how much fun it is to read, both of which are orthogonal to the ability to benefit the reader and often even trade off against it. 

The incentive structure for self-help is unfortunately set up in such a way that the traditional ways of cultivating engagement don’t work well with it.

What, then, to do?

+++++

* Don't participate in the zero-sum game. Attention-grabbing trade-offs are wrong to make, even if you think they'll work out well. It won't work out well.
*  How to think about polluting the general idea space vs writing more? Raises more questions. Well, blogs in general are good. FB is bad b/c audiences can't agree to see all of your stuff.
*  Create your own network (see theZvi for a blogroll)
