title: Black-box Explanations For Productivity Stuff
tags: rationality, bad-philosophy

You know how sometimes you're staring at a problem or a math proof, and you know that you *could* find the solution? But maybe you don't go all the way and actually explicate the solution. There's just the feeling of *existence* that's present.

I often feel a similar black-box-y feel when I'm thinking about justifying certain rationality techniques. As in, there's effort I could put in to "translate" whatever technique I'm using into a more Standard Ontology which makes it sound Reasonable. But sometimes, I just deal with existence proofs.
