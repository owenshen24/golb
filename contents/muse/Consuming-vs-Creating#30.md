title: Consuming vs Creating

This is similar to my previous post on Consumers and Creators. Except this time, instead of thinking about roles that people play, I'm thinking about the acts involved in each one of the roles. When you're Consuming, you're taking something in. It's a passive practice, like watching a movie or reading a book. Creating is about actively making something. Consuming takes less effort, so it's the default. But the useful work comes from Creating. 

What is the takeaway here?

- Taking note of when you're doing one over the other.
- Time doesn't make itself. Being okay to decline opportunities to do X with other people, if it's a Consuming-type activity.
- Noting the parallels to active vs passive, acting vs reacting, recognizing vs generating, etc. etc.
