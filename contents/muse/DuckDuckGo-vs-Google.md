title: DuckDuckGo vs Google

Sometimes people on Hacker News talk about how Google results are still better than those provided by DDG. They usually don't have any data to back it up. I use DDG on a daily basis, and I'm endeavoring to record the results pages which force me to use Google.

Here's one where I tried to search up "approximate independence", i.e. how to get independent samples, or something close to it:

You might need to open it in a new tab to see the image fully. But you can see the DDG results on the left and the Google results on the right. DDG clearly has some irrelevant results, like a unversity page and, oddly enough, a video game listing. On the other hand, Google even provides helpful Math StackExchange, which seems exactly like what I need.
