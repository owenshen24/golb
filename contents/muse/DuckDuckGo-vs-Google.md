title: DuckDuckGo vs Google

Sometimes people on Hacker News talk about how Google results are still better than those provided by DDG. They usually don't have any data to back it up. I use DDG on a daily basis, and I'm endeavoring to record the results pages which force me to use Google.

(You might need to open these images in a new tab to see the image fully.)

Here's one where I tried to search up "approximate independence", i.e. how to get independent samples, or something close to it.

You can see the DDG results on the left and the Google results on the right. DDG clearly has some irrelevant results, like a unversity page and, oddly enough, a video game listing. On the other hand, Google even provides helpful Math StackExchange, which seems exactly like what I need.

For this one, I was trying to find a specific paper written by one of my professors. You can see that DDG can't even find the paper, while Google instantly offers up several links.

Once again, I'm trying to find a specific chapter in a statistics book. DDG can't find the paper, while Google has it as the first result.
