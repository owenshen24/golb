title: Immersive Media

I'm pretty wary of watching movies because I think they're too immersive. I'm also wary of reading good books for the same reason. Doing so is like agreeing to have my waking hours punctuated with thoughts about the characters in said mediums and their plot points flow through my head. Mostly without much conscious input.
