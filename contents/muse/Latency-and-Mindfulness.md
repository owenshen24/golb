title: Latency and Mindfulness

I like it when my apps or software have longer latency and lag if the goal is to afford me more time to think. Having to wait a little while for Windows 98 was not a bad experience. I wonder how this interacts with my other desire for apps to responsive and fast?

Seems good to have things fast, most of the time, but I guess a more Ascended Aesthetic would have more thought put into designed lag.
