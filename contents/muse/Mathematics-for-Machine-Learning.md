title: Mathematics for Machine Learning
summary: Working through mml-book

I need to brush up on my formal understanding as well as the intuitions behind the maths in machine learning. To that end, I'll be working through exercises in Mathematics for Machine Learning as well as summarizing chapters.

# Linear Algebra

A vector space contains objects which are closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

To start, we consider systems of linear equations. Cool. Then, matrices. Matrices can be:

- added together
- scalar multiplied
- multiplied by other matrices (as long as row/column match up)

Some other notes:

* A symmetric matrix is one that is equal to its inverse.
* How can we solve systems of linear equations?
