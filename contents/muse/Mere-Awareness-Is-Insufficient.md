title: Mere Awareness Is Insufficient

Knowing about the problem isn't enough.
Knowing that it isn't enough also isn't enough.
Recursing all the way also generally doesn't get you there.
Maybe you can hack it with some sort of twisty reasoning about meta-meta-meta levels, but I'm pretty sure that sort of stuff isn't sustainable.
What *is* enough is actually just doing the thing. There's a skill to figuring out what needs to be done, noting the feeling of "doing it", and then repeating that.
