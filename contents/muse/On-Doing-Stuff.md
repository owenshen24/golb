title: On Doing Stuff

It seems like affordances are really important when talking about my ability to get stuff one. One part of it is paying attention to what sorts of things feel "normal" given the context. The other part has to do with trying to form some sort of self-concept, averaged over the past few days, and then seeing if what I'm doing is consistent with that.

The other-other part has to do with meditating on the notion of effort, and what it means to be in a position to put in effort. What feels off about doing work? What feels actually doable? If I think that I don't have enough time to fully finish a project, what does it feel like to make some progress? What is the feeling of sunk costs and wastefulness that lend themselves to not wanting to start? What is the wind-up time to get started?

Computers. Paper. Making progress. What are clearly defined goals? What is the feeling of drifting around, passively getting information? Is there any real merit to anything *but* intentional learning? How can you get better at this? Where do our intuitions break down?
