title: Pokemon with GANs

Something I've seen other people do, which seemed cool was using GANs to create Pokemon sprites. I decided to give this a go today. I pulled up the boilerplate code on PyTorch, and within an hour (and a few tweaks), I got these fun results:

<div style="text-align: center">
    <video width="400" height="400" controls="controls">
      <source src="../images/pokegan-transition.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

What start out as blobs eventually turn into…something more. 

Here you can see the training vs fakes side by side:

The real images are to the left, and the generated images are to the right. If you kinda squint, they do sorta look like Pokemon…eldritch horror-esque, nightmarish Pokemon…but Pokemon nonetheless. Maybe.

Here are some of the more intriguing ones:

An ice spirit of some sort? White hair, a clearly visible eye, and then maybe a tail and legs?

A small bipedal animal with a green lilypad hat?
