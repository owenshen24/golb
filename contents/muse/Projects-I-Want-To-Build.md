title: Projects I Want To Build

I don't know if this will end up being a frequently updated list, but there are at least two things which are on my to-do list, to be done eventually:

### Carbon Emissions Calculator

An interactive web-app where users can see projections for future carbon emissions, conditional on them taking certain actions. Also what happens if they convince their town, country, or the entire globe to follow suit.

### Social Networks for Blogs

Some sort of open protocol that abstracts the benefits afforded by social networks like Twitter or Facebook–i.e. followers, comments, centralized feed, sorting by user–except on the level of individual websits. Something like Wordpress or Disqus, except less bloated, more customizable, and no ads.
