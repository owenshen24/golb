title: Push and Pull

Here's something that fits into a 2x2:

|      | **Pull** | **Push** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Internal** | Doing something because you like it. | Doing something because you feel guilty otherwise. |
| **External** | Doing something because you'll get rewards. | Doing something because you'll get punished otherwise. |

Not sure how correct this is. I was musing about my own sources of motivation earlier, and I realzied that even internal motivation can be push/pull.
