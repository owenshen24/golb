title: Speediness 1
tags: virtue, aesthetic

It's now my second year of college. I suppose that Muse works more as a place for me to be far more casual about what's been up with my life. I'm not sure if many people read this. But whatever, I'm using this as a way to catalogue some of my messier thoughts.

Since coming back to college, I feel like I've been swept up in a far more frantic flow. Around this time my first year, I wanted to take *all* the cool classes and learn *all* the exciting things. Now, though, it seems like, after a year, I haven't exactly learned the virtue of Patience, but I'm okay being more...unfulfilled?

It no longer seems prudent to try and maximize all of the things or to take all of the classes. I think this is a little jarring. The pace of growing older seems so slow. Projects can take a while, and no one is ever in a rush to get things done.

At the risk of channeling the aesthetic of accelerating progress, acclimation, and fading novelty, I still think there is a Time and Place to be FAST.

There is something independent of the carelessness and hurry that accompanies the typical speediness. There is a more delibrate use of speed in the same way that focused attention does not discount the use of Blankness.
