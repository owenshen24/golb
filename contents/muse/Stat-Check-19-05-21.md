title: Stat Check 19-05-21

It's been a while now, but I've found that I really enjoy writing my dates in terms of year, month, day. This is like how numbers work, with the most significant bit coming first. It makes sorting things easier, which is nice.

I've been working on making my blog more usable. It might be good to have a hit counter. I'm feeling better about writing all of this stuff now, which is good. I haven't been exercising as much, and that's led to a resurgence of this bad prickly feeling when it's hot, which is annoying. Also I have to write a philosophy essay on the new riddle of induction, which is a little ugh.

Apart from that, I'm still trying to get into more of a habit of thinking / consuming the right media. I'm happy I got the SafeEyes app for my laptop. It's notifications are annoying (sometimes!), but I think it's important to keep having the habit of respecting it. 1 minute isn't that long!
