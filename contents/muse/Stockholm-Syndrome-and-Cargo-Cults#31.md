title: Stockholm Syndrome and Cargo Cults

Two concepts:

Stockholm Syndrome:

- A bunch of classes / requirements are probably only perpetuated because of Stockholm-Syndrome-esque reasons, where people think "Well, it's obviously good because I was required to do it."
- Also, maybe spite, ala "If I went through a bad experience, so should others!"

No one seems to understand how causal mechanisms are supposed to work, and there's cargo culting all the way down:

- Schools requiring students to meet the identifiers of a great essay (e.g. having at least 3 citations) will not produce great essays.
