title: Stuff I Wish I Were Doing

1. Stop going on Reddit.
2. Stop playing games.
3. Journal more regularly.
4. Do back exercises every day.
5. Spend 1 hour thinking every day.
6. Spend 1 hour working on a project I actually like every day.

Obviously some of the above are pica for other things. Trying to fit the need and take small steps is all part of it. Just writing some of the obvious ones down for now. There's a lot of hidden downtime between task switching and travel.
