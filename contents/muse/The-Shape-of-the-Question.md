title: The Shape of the Question

One incredibly useful razor that I use when thinking about philosophical questions is to ask myself what shape I expect the answer to look like, *conditional on an answer existing*. I've found that this does a good job of pointing out what's missing. Perhaps I need more information to decisively favor one side over the other, or perhaps the question doesn't even seem as sensible afterwards.
