title: Titles are Evil

[Malcolm Ocean gets it](https://malcolmocean.com/2016/02/sparkly-pink-purple-ball-thing/). There's a terrible thing that happens when you try to encapsulate your essay with a title. Somehow, the label takes on a life of its own, and you sometimes forget the content inside the essay.

And in fact it was not  boring and it was good.

I'm thinking of maybe instead transitioning to just numbers + summaries instead.

For example, a format like:
