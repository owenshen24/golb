title: Where Did The Excitement Go?

So it's been a while since my last blog post. It still feels weird writing all of my insecurities out into this weird internet void. But I figure it's better to get into more of a habit to be writing about things that are scaring me. Something about caring less and being more vulnerable or something.

Anyway, it seems like this year has been already half done. And I've been 20 for all this time. Not very exciting. If anything, I think that I've gotten worse in a lot of ways. Less blog posts, less of an adventuring attitude. And all that. Yikes.

Also, I recall a few years ago, someone said something about college killing your soul. I thought I held out for a bit, but now I can most definitely agree that there are negatives of going to college. Maybe it's the fashionable Millennial attitude to struggle with mental trauma. I certainly don't think tech's helping. I'd honestly like to get an e-reader, if only to be able to read more things on a format that isn't going to wreck my eyes.

My eyes are already largely wrecked. It's been harder to get all the exercise done this year. Lots of things don't feel exciting, but there are some bright patches. I think I'm getting into more of a groove with regards to how I relate to a few people, and that's good. (Imagined audiences, wowza, hello there.)

Also sort of just writing this to have a test-bed for the updates I made to Volta. Hopefully they work.
