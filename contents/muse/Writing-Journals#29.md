title: Writing Journals

It's been a while since I have written in my journal. This is quite odd, actually, as I have previously written in journals daily for 4-ish years. So that's been a habit I haven't been doing. I think that, on the whole, I have gotten less benefit out of it, but I'm not sure which way the causation flows.

I suppose I want to keep doing it, if only because keeping a journal also feels like a continuation of self. Otherwise, it feels like parts my life just slip through without any real mark that they've happened.
