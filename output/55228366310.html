<div class="content"><p>Advice is when people, uh, advise you to do a thing which (they think) will be helpful for you. Sometimes it&#39;s a very specific thing in particular (e.g. giving firm handshakes), and other times it&#39;s a more general thing (e.g. being &quot;assertive&quot; during negotiations). In either case, I think advice can be abstracted into telling someone to act a certain way, in a certain class of situations. There&#39;s the expectation of repeated behavior.</p>

<p>Good advice is when people tell you stuff which has the effect of actually causing you to do the thing. <strong>[Link to Good Self-Help is Self-Defeating]</strong>. Note that this might not involve telling you outright, &quot;Hey, you should do this thing X.&quot; They might instead tell a personal story of how they benefited from doing X, which changes your intuitions about how useful X is. Or they might cite some study. It seems like many people value insights they discover on their own more than insights other people tell them, which then affects how much they&#39;ll actually act on the insight. To that end, good advice encourages curiosity and independence about this whole self-help business.</p>

<p>Meta-advice is when people tell you stuff about how you should treat stuff other people tell you, in order to make it more helpful (or so they think). </p>
