      <div class="content"><p>In computer science, one of the biggest open questions concerns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">P vs NP</a>. This question asks whether or not problems that are quickly <em>verifiable</em> are also quickly <em>solvable</em>. This dichotomy isn't just academic in nature. It provides a good starting point for the discussion of the human analogue--<strong>Recognizing</strong> vs <strong>Generating</strong>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what I want to point to:</p>

<p>Say you have an outline, and an essay that was written using the outline as a guide. </p>

<p>You give both items to your friend. "Can you match up the outline to the essay?" you ask. Here, their goal is to see which bullet points on the outline were expanded into different sentences and paragraphs. It's not too difficult of a task.</p>

<p>This is a Recognizing task.</p>

<p>Now, say you only give the outline to your friend. "Can you use this outline to write an essay?" you ask. Here, their goal is to actually expand on the bullet points into full sentences and paragraphs. The amount of effort they need to put in seems to have increased a lot.</p>

<p>This is a Generating task.</p>

<p>The Recognizing task gives you something to work with, whereas the Generating task requires you to start from scratch. Both are related, but in the above example, it is easy to see that the two are not the same thing. The difference isn't always so clear-cut.</p>

<p>Consider another example:</p>

<p>A student is reading their textbook, studying for their math exam. They go over the proof in their book. "Does this step make sense?" they ask themselves. They make sure they can follow what's going on before moving to the next step.</p>

<p>This is a Recognizing task.</p>

<p>Now, say the student closes the textbook. "How did that proof go, again?" they ask themselves. They derive each step, trying to see what makes sense, given what they want to prove.</p>

<p>This is a Generating task.</p>

<p>Put in this context, perhaps the distinction is clear. But when people think about "studying for math", I think both the Recognizing and the Generating can seem like correct things to do. But only one of them is going to help you when the test asks you to prove something from scratch.</p>

<p>I think this is why math can end up being a difficult subject. It’s all too easy to fool yourself that you understand what's going on when you’re just following along with the textbook. Cover up the steps, though, and try to solve the problem yourself, and things get a lot harder.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, when you’re reading a book and the author says, “Now, obviously, we can conclude X,” you should take a step back and see what you think. If the author hadn’t presented you with the conclusion, could you have generated it with the pieces you already had?</p>

<p>For humans, it seems very clear that Recognizing tasks (i.e. P) are easier than Generating tasks (i.e. NP). As such, you'd expect to see many more instances of Recognizing, even if Generating is what produces more useful work.</p>

<p>For example, if you’ve ever been in a group discussion, you’ve probably never had a shortage of people willing to critique ideas that gets proposed. But it's not often that you have many people willing to share lots of ideas. And from an effort perspective, that makes sense: it’s far easier to point out why an idea is bad (after all, basically every plan will have drawbacks!) than to come up with ideas in the first place. This isn’t to say that criticism isn’t important, but I do think it’s important to acknowledge this asymmetry in effort that’s being put in by both sides.</p>

<p>In this specific example, one takeaway might be to offer up more ideas early, even if you think they're bad, because criticism will arise anyway. Better to offer your group a wider selection of ideas (and have them improved by criticism) than to hold it in.</p>

<p>So that's one example where the Recognizing vs Generating distinction offers insight. In general, I think the distinction is useful because it is easy to mix up the two, when it comes to self-help.</p>

<ol>

</ol>

<p>++++</p>

<p>Lastly, a more general example of this Recognize vs Generate distinction has to do with coming up with ideas. If you’ve ever been in a group discussion, you’ve probably never had a shortage of people willing to critique ideas that are proposed. But having a steady stream of ideas proves to be harder.</p>

<p>Once again, I think the distinction is at work here. It’s far more easier to point out why an idea is bad (after all, basically every plan will have drawbacks!) than to come up with ideas in the first place. This isn’t to say that criticism isn’t important, but I do think it’s important to acknowledge this asymmetry in effort that’s being put in by both sides.</p>

<p>I think that one of the most useful ways to use this distinction is when people give advice. </p>

<p>I claim that basically everyone who gives advice is doing it wrong.</p>

<p>The tldr; is that I think that pretty much all advice people give falls into the Recognizable category, when they should really be thinking in a more Generating style.</p>

<p>Here’s what I think roughly goes into people’s heads when they try to give advice into another human:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Think of several experiences where things turned out well for them. 
EX: “That time I won the free laptop, that time I scored the awesome job, and that time that I asked Andy to the dance.”</p></li>
<li><p>Try to find some common threads between all of the experiences. 
EX: “Well, I did always start with a good impression, I always introduced myself well in all of those times…”</p></li>
<li><p>Distill it into something general. Give it out as advice.
EX: “Remember to always start with a strong handshake!”</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So your experienced friend, hoping to impart some worldly advice, tells you to always start with a strong handshake. And that advice promptly gets filed under your “Boring Advice” drawer in your head, never to be seen again.</p>

<p>I think that the core problem here is that your friend hasn’t done a good job of accurately conveying the reasons for the advice given.</p>

<p>From inside their heads, they have access to all of their experiences, so once they’ve got the generalized piece of advice—”Remember to always start with a strong handshake!”—which they can check against their memories to verify if it’s a good match.</p>

<p>They’re able to quickly recognize that the advice checks out.</p>

<p>But, for you, the advice-getter, you don’t have access to any of those experiences. </p>

<p>So the best you, the advice-getter, can do is imagine a few situations where the advice kinda works out, and it’s not at all as convincing and obviously “good” as the advice-giver thinks it is.</p>

<p>I think that advice becomes far better when you start taking a Generative approach towards things.</p>

<p>Now, instead of looking for common threads, you ask yourself, “What information would I have needed in those situations in order to have come up with those positive actions in the first place?” </p>

<p>Rather than checking to see if your outcomes match the advice you give, you’re now actually checking to see if the advice you give even leads to those outcomes in the first place. </p>

<p>Which is great because it better aligns your thinking with that of the advice-getter’s. It means you’re thinking about what they do and don’t know. Which means you’re less likely to fall prey to the illusion of transparency, the cognitive bias where we assume that everything we know is also known by the other party.</p>

<p>There’s a certain sense here where you’re modeling humans as complicated input-output machines, and you’re trying to see what sort of input would generate the best outputs. </p>

<p>If we turn this back to the handshake example, an attempt to be more Generative might look like this:</p>

<p>Your helpful friend tells you, “Hey, so whenever you meet someone, you should definitely check out the hills and valley of their hand. It’s totally groovy!”</p>

<p>Now, your curiosity is piqued. The next time you meet another human, you squeeze their hand, trying to figure out where the hills and valleys are. To your surprise, they respond, “Hey, nice handshake!” and the rest of the meeting goes swimmingly well.</p>

<p>As a result, you think to yourself, “Gee, it turns out that handshakes are pretty great when they’re firm!”</p>

<p>This is undoubtedly a silly toy example. </p>

<p>But I hope it illustrates how a large part of advice is letting the other person figure out the actual advice for themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, note that the dichotomy goes both ways: If you’re receiving advice from someone that your brain is quickly labeling as “obvious”, it’s a good idea to do a check and see if you could have come up with it yourself if they hadn’t told you.</p>

<p>And I don’t mean to imply that this model is the only or best way of giving advice. </p>

<p>There’s certainly other ways, from going meta (EX: acknowledging that the advice sounds boring and/or obvious), finding ways to quickly shift intuitions (EX: telling a memorable anecdote), to bridging the differences in experience (EX: give more background information).</p>

<p>But I think that the Recognize vs Generate distinction is still a highly useful one that can find itself into many more discussions. </p>

<p>In general, taking note of this dichotomy means we want to avoid the surface-level similarities of what, at their very core, are quite different activities (i.e. recognizing vs generating). </p>

<p>The obvious takeaway is that the effort required for the two tasks is very different, despite their apparent similarities. The slightly deeper one is thinking in a more input-output style where you’re trying to imagine fitting pieces together to get the end result.</p>
