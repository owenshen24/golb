      <div class="content"><p>A few years ago, I was viscerally scared by the thought of the world ending. It felt a lot closer than it does now. Also, since a few years ago, I've become a few years older. It's scary to think that this is probably one of the things that happens to you when you become more of an adult.</p>

<p>Propps to all the other EAs who can reckon with these feelings still even after whatever general-emotional-stability-boost-that-inadvertently-makes-it-harder-to-get-invested-in-dangerous-scenarios kicks in.</p>

<p>Given that I don't really feel this way, it's also been harder to tackle problems that relate to stuff in this scope. So effective altruism as a general philosophy feels less attractive, which also seems to suck. I think that...I've become more selfish in recent years?</p>

<p>I'm working on projects still, but they're not all interesting, and I feel like sometimes I forget to focus on the right goal of helping people.</p>

<p>This is worth spending more time Focusing on.</p>
