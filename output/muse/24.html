      <div class="content"><p>It's a little weird. I haven't been really doing lots of rationality stuff or introspection. And I think this correlates with enjoying life a lot less. These past few months have been, in general, not super great. Barring the part where I went and dug deep into neural networks and came out feeling very able with automatic differentiation / backprop proofs, I'm not really in a state where I feel like I'm dropping insights left and right.</p>

<p>And it seems like even if I think that I'm saying the same stuff over and over again, the fact that I have ideas in and of itself seems to be evidence that something good is happening in my head. And when I don't have that, it seems less good.</p>

<p>At least I'm not too burdened with work this quarter. Something-something finding the time to be reflective. Well, I tried the meditative experiential lying on the ground thing, and it was ineffective.</p>

<p>I got completely steamrolled by my desire to get some tasty instant reinforcement. Cue Pokemon Showdown, Smash Bros, and even a resurgence of Dominion. </p>

<p>I wish I could be more of the type of person who could look past those things. Coin magic's also seeing a resurgence. I think the answer will involve building things up again.</p>
