      <div class="content"><p>So it's been a while since my last blog post. It still feels weird writing all of my insecurities out into this weird internet void. But I figure it's better to get into more of a habit to be writing about things that are scaring me. Something about caring less and being more vulnerable or something.</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems like this year has been already half done. And I've been 20 for all this time. Not very exciting. If anything, I think that I've gotten worse in a lot of ways. Less blog posts, less of an adventuring attitude. And all that. Yikes.</p>

<p>Also, I recall a few years ago, someone said something about college killing your soul. I thought I held out for a bit, but now I can most definitely agree that there are negatives of going to college. Maybe it's the fashionable Millennial attitude to struggle with mental trauma. I certainly don't think tech's helping. I'd honestly like to get an e-reader, if only to be able to read more things on a format that isn't going to wreck my eyes.</p>

<p>My eyes are already largely wrecked. It's been harder to get all the exercise done this year. Lots of things don't feel exciting, but there are some bright patches. I think I'm getting into more of a groove with regards to how I relate to a few people, and that's good. (Imagined audiences, wowza, hello there.)</p>

<p>Also sort of just writing this to have a test-bed for the updates I made to Volta. Hopefully they work.</p>
