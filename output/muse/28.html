      <div class="content"><p>One common theme that I return to, time and time again, is that of addictiveness. More specifically, what makes something habit-forming in a bad way? I've previously talked about this in the context of Attractors. Lately, my thing to hate on is mobile games, or the thing that they represent. Which, yes, is a little late to the game. And I don't even play games on my mobile phone, so it seems a little out of place.</p>

<p>But I digress. The point here is to talk about the Skinner Box. Or, the application of the same concept to human things. Gamification and notification spam both fall into this category. But maybe not games. But maybe some games. Definitely mobile games. The point here is that there's this category I want to get some clarity on, and it's about these things which seem habit-forming and suck you in.</p>

<p>So, what's clearly a Skinner Box? I think that clicker games are totally Skinner Boxes. Also Clash of Clans, Farmville (i.e. everything Zynga / Zynga-clones). But this line is often hazy; Candy Box was innovative and exciting in certain ways. There was a game a while back about alpacas eating one another that seemed surprisingly deep for an idle game. It's one thing to put on a sophisticated veneer on a game, but it still seems fine to critique the underlying mechanics.</p>

<h5>What <em>does</em> make a Skinner Box?</h5>

<ol>
<li>Lack of a challenge
<ol>
<li>Despite having progression, idle and clicker games don't really have anything that forces the player to do anything strategic. They just...click things, and they get reinforcement.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Instant gratification
<ol>
<li>Mobile games often leverage this desire by time-locking content, prompting you to pay in order to get something <em>now</em>. The other thing to pay attention here is if the feedback loop is tight.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Addictiveness / rewards for continuing
<ol>
<li>Intermittent rewards / unpredictability. (Think FB's notification structure.)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p><br/></p>

<h4>What <em>doesn't</em> make a Skinner Box?</h4>

<ol>
<li>Skill and growth
<ol>
<li>Platformers often require lots of timing. Fighting games require practice. The more something is like a sport / instrument, it seems that it's less Skinner Box-y. Although if the prevalence of games like LoL is any indication, there are still addictive elements present.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Decision-making
<ol>
<li>Rewarding players for making good choices</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Meaning
<ol>
<li>If you spin a narrative / make something "deep" or philosophical / claim artistic purpose, it seems like you can take more liberties with mechanics.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Instrumentality
<ol>
<li>If we're hungry, we eat and we eat. And no one seems to get upset about this. It seems like the degree to which the action in question is important for achieving our other goals also affects this social judgment.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course there's the question: <strong>Is EVERYTHING a Skinner Box?</strong>
Well, no because then the word becomes useless. So the point here is to tease out where the boundaries of what is / isn't acceptable when it comes to addictiveness / habit-forming behavior.</p>
