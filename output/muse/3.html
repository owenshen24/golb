      <div class="content"><p>So I've been using Todoist as my to-do list of choice for over a year now. This feels pretty good and great. I don't think it's the optimal to-do list app, of course. It keeps nagging me to upgrade to Premium for features I really don't care for.</p>

<p>However, it seems like having a to-do list is way better than not having one. And, perhaps more generally, having some sort of coping technique is good. Having a way to reflect is good. Anyway. The point here is that having any sort of way to do other than your evolutionary defaults seems to be helpful. At least, a good number of things seem to be useful.</p>

<p>This seems to be why so much of self-help attracts a following; regardless of the models or epistemology involved, they all seem to be pointing towards a general cluster of stuff that works. And it seems like they could all be good choices of things if your objective is to get short-term gain.</p>
