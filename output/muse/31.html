        <div class="content"><p>Two concepts:</p>

<p>Stockholm Syndrome:</p>

<ul>
<li>A bunch of classes / requirements are probably only perpetuated because of Stockholm-Syndrome-esque reasons, where people think "Well, it's obviously good because I was required to do it."</li>
<li>Also, maybe spite, ala "If I went through a bad experience, so should others!"</li>
</ul>

<p>No one seems to understand how causal mechanisms are supposed to work, and there's cargo culting all the way down:</p>

<ul>
<li>Schools requiring students to meet the identifiers of a great essay (e.g. having at least 3 citations) will not produce great essays.</li>
</ul>
