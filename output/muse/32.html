        <div class="content"><p>I'm currently at Microsoft. We're really big on growth mindset. It feels fake when corporate people try to espouse it. It also feels fake when we try to have good dialogues at work. See cargo culting. Yes, talking about these things is probably good, but only in the right environments w/ the right people. Otherwise it feels fake, like we're pretending.</p>

<p>Maybe this is what happens to many great ideas (e.g. study skills) when they get institutionalized? Cue all the great ideas in school / work that seem ridiculous because of the context or the way they're introduced. Does anyone actually buy this, in the way it's supposed to be intended?</p>
