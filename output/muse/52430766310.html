<div class="content"><p>Thinking about why the Voted Perceptron works well. It works because if you have data that&#39;s generally linearly separable, then the weights which have survived the longest are a good proxy for the true value. Similarly, if you instead run each updated set of weights against the entire dataset, you can probably get a good indication for how well a set of weights is doing.</p>

<p>But this seems sort of artificial, mainly because I just flipped a few points. It seems like a better version of this is to try it ona dataset with some actual inherent nonlinearity, e.g. some Gaussians or something like that.</p>

<p>Otherwise, maybe some sort of ensemble method that uses a decision tree to decide which perceptron to apply...? That&#39;s a little extreme...</p>

<p>Anyway, the other thing with the delta trick seems too complex, in that it could easily blow up your dimensionality...and I&#39;m still confused about what the curse of dimensionality is about...</p>

<p>But anyhow, I think the next thing to do is to run the delta trick perceptron and see if it can classify all of the points correctly. That&#39;s of course good for reducing empirical risk, but it feels pretty brittle, especially if it&#39;s really just noise...but maybe it&#39;d be good for actually nonlinear datasets.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is what I want to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement the delta trick. See what it looks like.

<ol>
<li>See if it can classify everything correctly.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Add Voted Perceptron visualization to the website.</li>
