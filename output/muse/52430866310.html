<div class="content"><p>Just getting my thoughts out here. So it&#39;s been a week since I finished my winter quarter at school, and I&#39;ve finally largely recuperated. COVID-19 is wrecking the US, and the markets have tanked. I feel like things might tank more? </p>

<p>Anyway, this is to give an overview of what I&#39;ve been thinking about.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I haven&#39;t really been doing CFAR or rationality techniques lately, but I think there are some persistent guiding principles:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be Curious

<ol>
<li>lends yourself towards authentic relationships</li>
<li>important for scholarship</li>
<li>encourages the skill of asking questions</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Be Explicit

<ol>
<li>Write down the stuff that you&#39;ll forget</li>
<li>Specify plans or they&#39;ll go unexecuted</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Founder&#39;s Pledge has a great overview on how individual action contributes to carbon emissions <a href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-and-lifestyle-report">here</a>. </p>

<ol>
<li>Questions I still have:

<ol>
<li>What does the plan for zero-carbon emissions look like? Countries transitioning to this plan need to somehow shift over their entire energy production system, right? Isn&#39;t that a massive undertaking?</li>
<li>The charts aren&#39;t clear on how much indvidual action can reduce total emissions. Are the per-capita numbers simply the country&#39;s emissions divided by the amount of people? If so, doesn&#39;t that shift a bunch of emissions from companies to people? If so, that seems like it misdirects the responsibility (especially as individual actions likely can&#39;t affect that large chunk).</li>
<li>No mention of geoengineering? What about the thing where existing carbon emissions haven&#39;t fully realized their effect on Earth? Where does carbon capture fit in? How mature is it? What are the costs involved?</li>
<li>How can we get this information into the general memeplex? Are policymakers already informed? What about the Generally Informed Scientific Layperson?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
