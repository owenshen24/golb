<div class="post-title">Levels of Criticism</div>
<div class="content"><p>Cue <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9kcTNWopvXFncXgPy/intellectual-hipsters-and-meta-contrarianism">meta-contrarianism</a> for criticism. It looks something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Criticism is bad, and if you don&#39;t like something, just don&#39;t say anything.</li>
<li>Criticism is good, and if you notice something wrong, just say it.</li>
<li>Criticism is sometimes useful, and you should weigh the net benefits before giving it.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the flip side, it seems like when responding to criticism, it&#39;s okay to let things be flawed. It seems better to let the other person give you lots and lots of criticism, and then you try to fix what you think is reasonable.</p>
<p>This seems to be in favor of letting people give you more criticism, as a general rule. One negative of this is that getting criticism often feels bad. And it feels bad, not because of the obligation aspect (as in &quot;oh no, now I have to respond to this criticism&quot;) but because it seems to say something about your worth (as in &quot;ah yes, this criticism shows that you are a bad person&quot;).</p>
<p>Obviously, taking a good epistemic stance will stem all of this, ala Litany of Gendlin type stuff (&quot;it is what it is, and I&#39;ll respond how I can&quot;), but anyhow, I was just thinking about criticism because I&#39;ve been writing some comments on one of my friend&#39;s drafts.</p>
