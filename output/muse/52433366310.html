<div class="post-title">Explicating Removes The Uncertainty. And The Fun</div>
<div class="content"><p>I&#39;m usually a big fan of explicating. Uncertainty can give a false sense of security, and forcing things to be specific can expose those flaws. It&#39;s also much easier to then execute on your plans if they&#39;re neatly out. Decoupling the thinking and the doing can both be more efficient and lead to better outcomes.</p>
<p>One thing that&#39;s come up recently is this sense of, &quot;Why bother doing something if I already know how it can be done?&quot;</p>
<p>I have this view which assigns most of the intellectual work to figuring out how something works. So once that&#39;s done, it seems a lot less exciting to go and actually do the thing. After all, if I&#39;ve already figured it out, then the actual doing part should be a lot more mindless, right? Maybe this is why all the thinky people go into theoretical subjects.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s a lot more fun when doing things to not have all of it figured out, for example when I&#39;m coding. (Yes, I know, dangerous for anything you can&#39;t redo, looking at you, AGI.) But I guess one downside of explicating, then, is that <em>if</em> you are like me, and attribute a lot of the &quot;real work&quot; to figuring out <em>how</em> to do something, then actually doing it afterwards will seem really boring.</p>
<p>This seems related to why I find it more fun to have a high-level overview for a talk, rather than memorizing all of the words beforehand. It&#39;s good to have a guide for what to say, but part of the fun (and skill) is improvising on the spot.</p>
<p>I realize this isn&#39;t something that scales well to large projects. So maybe part of the challenge here is figuring out ways to make the &quot;just doing it&quot; part more exciting. For me, I find self-worth in making stuff happen, so I do have some higher-level motivations to actually do the work.</p>
<p>But it&#39;s interesting, for small projects at least, to consider how much more motivated I&#39;d be, if I actually planned less.</p>
