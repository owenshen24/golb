<div class="post-title">Overcorrecting As Deliberate Practice</div>
<div class="content"><p>Something that I&#39;ve gotten a lot of value out of, when learning many different things, is to deliberately overcorrect, when I notice I&#39;m doing something the wrong way. For example, if I&#39;m trying to hit the ball straight on a golf club, and I&#39;m always hitting to the left, I make a deliberate effort to hit it to the right, rather than just trying to hit straight. Or if I&#39;m speaking my lines too fast, I will slow down and try to speak them at 0.75x speed instead of just 1.0x speed.</p>

<p>In these situations, what often ends up happening is that, instead of actually overcorrecting in the opposite direction, it turns out that the amount of effort I&#39;m putting in to intentionally try and do the opposite thing is actually just about what&#39;s needed to make me hit the happy medium. If I instead strove for just trying to reach the medium, I would likely still be biased in the same direction, but just less so.</p>

<p>The other benefit is getting a feel for the entire range of motion / the entire action space. By default, I think I feel cautions to try and overcorrect or overextend. There&#39;s some part of me that thinks, &quot;Well, I&#39;m already obviously biased towards X, why try and become biased towards not-X?&quot; There&#39;s some sort of fear there of &quot;Is trying to be extra wrong in the other direction even allowed?&quot; and some internal disdain, like &quot;I shouldn&#39;t try and intentionally do something <em>wrong</em>!&quot;</p>

<p>But I think the right thing to do is to flip that gut feeling around–&quot;If I&#39;m already biased towards X, then I already have a propensity for it. In that case, it makes really good sense to try and understand the things I&#39;m not good at, which in this case is not-X!&quot; This is really good experiential knowledge from a purely exploratory standpoint, as well as from a skill gain perspective.</p>
