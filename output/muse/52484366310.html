<div class="content"><p>So. I&#39;m 22 now. Wow, well, my 21st year went by pretty fast. Subjectively. This year has been one of monumental mistakes, high stakes, and incredible lows. But I&#39;m still here. Through it all, I&#39;ve found myself through to the other side with most of my sanity intact. I don&#39;t think that I&#39;m that much more effective or, really, that much smarter. COVID really mseed up some of my schedules, and I think I missed out on some potentially-very-fun experiences. I won&#39;t list eveerything that went right or wrong–I&#39;ll leave that for the Year End Review. Yet, despite all of this, I can&#39;t help but feel optimistic and excited. If a little, at least.</p>
<p>I&#39;m growing older, and, as always, progress isn&#39;t linear. But still time goes on. We take our rests and make our moves. Not a beseechment to stick to script, of course. There&#39;s always room to be mindful and strategic. But I&#39;ve got what I&#39;ve got. Regret&#39;s going to stick with me. And at some points, I seriously need to take a step back and reevaluate my strategies. I think the second half of this year was definitely marked by the sort of carelessness in thought I wish to avoid… and that&#39;s what it is. Instead of resignation or despair (which seemed to have colored last year&#39;s retrospective on turning 21), I think I&#39;ve grappled with more regret and acceptance this year. Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m that good at it though.</p>
<p>Maybe a more traditional return form?</p>
<p>I think I&#39;m far from being regimented, and it&#39;s unclear I want that (but of course the aesthetic, as always, is beckoning.) I didn&#39;t manage to regularly exercise or think about hard problems. But I did get better at learning Chinese, so that was pretty solid. I think i overall want to be more thoughtful and do reviews like this more often. Something about how having a little bit of systemized planning goes a massively long way, and there being huge discrepancies in how effective people are or something.</p>
<p>It exposes my thinking patterns and explicates my thinking; this helps me identify patterns I want to change. How can I encourage writing more?</p>
<p>Well, I think in general it&#39;s easiest to write about stuff when:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#39;ve just finished exercising and let my mind wander.</li>
<li>I just fucked up and my brain&#39;s running on double time trying to figure out exactly what went wrong.</li>
<li>I&#39;m generally not that stressed out (like right now), and I can afford to lounge about a little bit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyhow, I&#39;m worried I&#39;m not actively improving myself. Setting goals seems like something fun to do (does it really, though?), but obviously how do you hit your goals without tracking them. So there&#39;s that. For my 22nd year, I want to massively up my Chinese proficiency, 10x my investments, and make some more net-positive research for the world.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#39;t be that hard. Game on.</p>
