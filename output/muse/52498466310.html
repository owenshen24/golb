<div class="content"><p>It seems like affordances are really important when talking about my ability to get stuff one. One part of it is paying attention to what sorts of things feel &quot;normal&quot; given the context. The other part has to do with trying to form some sort of self-concept, averaged over the past few days, and then seeing if what I&#39;m doing is consistent with that.</p>

<p>The other-other part has to do with meditating on the notion of effort, and what it means to be in a position to put in effort. What feels off about doing work? What feels actually doable? If I think that I don&#39;t have enough time to fully finish a project, what does it feel like to make some progress? What is the feeling of sunk costs and wastefulness that lend themselves to not wanting to start? What is the wind-up time to get started?</p>

<p>Computers. Paper. Making progress. What are clearly defined goals? What is the feeling of drifting around, passively getting information? Is there any real merit to anything <em>but</em> intentional learning? How can you get better at this? Where do our intuitions break down?</p>
