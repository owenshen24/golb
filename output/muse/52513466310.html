<div class="post-title">Unread Emails: A Biased Survey</div>
<div class="content"><p>So a while back, I&#39;ve noticed that my parents have lots of unread emails, somewhere in the thousands. A lot of them seemed to be spam or marketing emails. I also know of lots of people who seem to be very good at managing their inbox. For me personally, I have around 0-10 emails unread in my inbox, as I keep emails I want to respond to unread, or emails which represent to-dos.</p>

<p>It seemed likely there was a bimodal distribution, with lots of people close to zero, and lots of people at infinity, or whatever the max email limit is. To figure this out, I ran a super informal survey on my Facebook friends, and I got 80 responses. I give the results below:</p>

<p>(Note the data can be found <a href="/assets/unread_emails.csv">here</a>. If you want to add your data, you can take the survey <a href="https://forms.gle/KNpDpt54TvjEiPzX9">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a histogram which shows the general distribution:</p>

<p><img src="/images/unread_emails_hist.png" alt="histogram of unread email values"></p>

<p>It looks like most people are at most at the several thousands, with a very long tail of people in the tens of thousands. If we zoom in, though, we realize most people are far from even one thousand.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the same distribution, now log-scaled:</p>

<p><img src="/images/unread_emails_hist_log.png" alt="histogram of unread emails, log scaled"></p>

<p>Now we see that around half of the participants are at 100 unread emails or less. Out of the 80 participants, 25 of them had exactly 0 emails in their inbox. In general, I think my friends are much more productivity focused than the general crowd. I expect more people to have heard of things like inbox zero.</p>

<p>I also asked for the participants&#39; ages. Most people were between 18 and 35. I&#39;ve plotted the them below in a scatter-plot:</p>

<p><img src="/images/unread_emails_scatter.png" alt="scatterplot of age and unread email count"></p>

<p>Maybe an older (or younger) crowd would have different numbers? I don&#39;t expect to draw any grand conclusions from this all. Mostly just to sate my own curiosity.</p>
