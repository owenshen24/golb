<div class="content"><p>I was talking with RJ earlier, and I think I finally articulated what I think is a core feature of my philosophy. I value the production of work much higher than its certification. I think, here in college, a lot of people seem to care about things like getting internships at prestigious companies. Something about how the achievement says something good about your skills or worth. And, in response, I&#39;ve often taken the arrogant stance of assuming that I&#39;m better than them. </p>

<p>Not on the same terms, mind you, (because sometimes I didn&#39;t get offers from those prestigious companies), But by appealing to how I have things like a cool blog, or I&#39;m good at making vector art, or something. Especially the cool blog bit ;-). Also, Z&#39;s been reading some Marx lately, wherein he (Marx, that is) writes about how production is good because it&#39;s the expression of one&#39;s self. And then it clicked. It turns out I value the production of stuff quite highly. It&#39;s important to me to always be creating stuff because that&#39;s what&#39;s valuable, and it&#39;s also important to be able to be the sort of person who can do stuff.</p>
