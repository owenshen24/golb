<div class="content"><p>For the past few years, my default example of a weird thing you can learn to observe skill development (and thus potentially abstract general principles) has been close-up magic.</p>

<p>Lately, I&#39;ve found myself surprised at getting quite a bit better at something that&#39;s also sort of arcane: arcade dance rhythm games like Pump It Up and Dance Dance Revolution. It helps that there&#39;s a free Pump It Up game at my university, so I can play it a lot. And I&#39;ve been playing it a lot.</p>

<p>There was a little bit of deliberate practice involved, where I looked up the foot patterns for a few songs and played them (tapping my feet on the ground, sitting in my chair) at 0.5x speed so I could better move my feet.</p>

<p>But most of it has been just brute playing.</p>

<p>For these games, the difficulty level goes quite high. And something that has felt like an art more than a science has been knowing when I can advance to the next difficulty level. It doesn&#39;t help that different songs at the same difficulty level can still be relatively easier or harder. Sometimes, I&#39;ll try to challenge myself and play something harder, and I&#39;ll completely fail. But sometimes, I&#39;ll realize that the song is doable, and then I&#39;ll just keep playing at the new level.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not gonna analyze this too much, but it&#39;s pretty cool for me to see that I finally got good at this thing which I associated with a cool aesthetic growing up.</p>

<p>I think, in general, it&#39;s made me better at rhythm games of all sorts.</p>

<p>This is especially interesting because, growing up, I was terrible with rhythm games. I hated them. There&#39;s a terribly annoying part in Ventus&#39;s story in Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep where you need to shoot ice cream scoops. I got stuck at that part, and I just couldn&#39;t progress the plot anymore. Anyway, now I don&#39;t suck at rhythm games.</p>
