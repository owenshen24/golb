<div class="content"><p>I used to better at just doing the thing I needed to do. Lately, I&#39;ve been needing to resort to effort. I don&#39;t think this is the optimal ontology. Ideally, I&#39;d just be inclined to do the things I want to do. So probably this is a sign of some disconnect, and I really just need to check in with my gut about what feels improtant and restructure my intuitions. </p>

<p>But in the meantime, I am taking the opportunity to meditate on the feeling of effort.</p>

<p>Effort feels like a shift when I plan to do something I hadn&#39;t previously planned. If I see myself doing something, or if I expect myself to do something, then it&#39;s not that effortful to make it happen. Effort is the thing that happens when I deviate from my current plans.</p>

<p>Effort is about directing attention (or is that what focus is about?)</p>

<p>Effort seems correlated with energy level. If I feel excited to do something, I feel more energized to do it. My body feels lighter, there&#39;s no weight in my chest, and I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s &quot;a drag&quot;. Putting in effort means making something happen even when it feels like I tearing myself away from some other path. It also feels like pushing through when I&#39;m fatigued. I think exercises analogies can help bridge some of this intuition, but not all of it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s super annoying when my body sends me a signal that I&#39;m tired, when I&#39;m working on something that requires effort. This makes me think it&#39;s a good idea to take a break. Which <em>incidentally</em> also has the side effect of making me stop whatever thing was effortful. Huh. </p>

<p>So something about how I think that the effortful thing is actually being harmful or something. I don&#39;t think you can escape effort.</p>

<p>Unclear if stuff should be easy.</p>

<p>I think it could be a struggle still, but it could be a good sort of struggle.</p>

<p>Stuff that hurts but feels good because you wanted to do it.</p>

<p>Wanting to do stuff for myself and of my own volition ranks super, super highly, now that I reflect on it. There&#39;s something about how it&#39;s really related to my sense of identity. Huh; I don&#39;t think I ever connected this to the philosophical notion of freedom. Maybe not free will, but something about feeling more motivated if I decide, rather than the explicit notion of someone else deciding for me.</p>

<p>But deciding to put in effort doesn&#39;t always make it happen.</p>

<p>It might still just be a struggle. The bad things can&#39;t just disappear. (Maybe they can? Hedonic treadmill says no?)</p>
