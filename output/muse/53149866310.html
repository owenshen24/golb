<div class="content"><p>I think that, as humans, we collectively underestimate how BIG a &quot;small&quot; number of things can feel. There&#39;s a few things here. One is that we ruminate stuff that happens, so events might mentally feel several times longer because we keep thinking about it. </p>

<p>Motivating example: I now nod to people that I see in several of my new classes this quarter. In just three classes, people feel like old friends. That is <em>really</em> fast. Maybe social experiences are the outlier here, but I don&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>Something about how the numbers from 1-20 are actually pretty big. Nate Soares has a thing about this, too. Like, in the entire quarter, I have at most 20 weekends, but it feels like a long time. Most vacations that people take are typically 7 days or less. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a weird bias here because &quot;days&quot; and &quot;seconds&quot; are the default units of time, I think that they&#39;re supposed to be &quot;short&quot;. But people can respond ot stuff at over 60 fps, which is some evidence that maybe the correct unit is something like 10 milliseconds. </p>

<p>In the case of a day, we actually go to sleep, so it does seem like a pretty good way to break things up.</p>

<p>But the concept of a week, I think, is far too long. Because we think in terms of weeks, it feels like they&#39;re a small building block. But a week is a long time!</p>

<p>Maybe this also applies to other things, like eating. (Eating 3 sandwiches is a lot.) And reading (reading 10 pages and really getting the value out of it is a lot).</p>

<p>Perhaps related: gradualism isn&#39;t that gradual because small changes aren&#39;t that small because our sense of scale is all messed up.</p>
