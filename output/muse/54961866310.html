<div class="content"><h3>Knowing Isn&#39;t Enough</h3>

<p>Say that you have a problem, and you know that you&#39;re doomed to fail.</p>

<ol>
<li>Knowing that you have a problem isn&#39;t enough.</li>
<li>Knowing that knowing you have a problem isn&#39;t enough.</li>
<li>Knowing that knowing that...all the way down isn&#39;t enough. </li>
<li>Maybe at some point you&#39;ll find enough meta-justification that it spurs you to Go Do The Thing, but I doubt it&#39;ll be consistent.</li>
<li>What does sorta work, is just straight-up doing it. Paying attention to what it feels like when you don&#39;t want to do it. Then doing it.</li>
</ol>

<p>This feels weird because it runs contra to the advice of &quot;listen to what you want and just do that&quot;. I want a lot of things. And I&#39;m a self-feeding cycle, where things I do as output get put back as input. So stuff I do has an effect on future stuff I do. Consistency counts a lot because mostly it&#39;s a sliding window which controls what I feel excited by. Also, myths and stories. If I convince myself that X is sexy, I&#39;ll want to do more X. </p>

<p>When you fail, one correct response is to slowly work your way back up. You can do that with small successes, of doing the thing you want, on a smaller scale. In general, you want to be rewarding the correct behavior (ala shaping), but also just generally rewarding doing anything at all.</p>

<h3>Modeling Progress</h3>

<p>Progress isn&#39;t linear, and every day isn&#39;t a save point. But you&#39;re learning more stuff, even if you&#39;re not retaining all of it. Sliding window shows up again. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a disconnect between the most biologically accurate description and the most beneficial ontology for what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>When thinking about growth, there might be some upward trends. But what do you care about? Rate of growth? The integral of all the stuff so far? Relative rate?</p>

<p>Probably some of them are true. But being specific might also mire you, if you choose something that you can&#39;t really optimize for.</p>

<p>I think I want to choose to maximize net output over time, or something like it. But I also care about how I feel on a day to day. I care about making sure my median feelings are fairly good.</p>
