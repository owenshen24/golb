<div class="post-title">What Makes Good Exercises?</div>
<div class="date">Last Updated: 2019-09-07 21:44</div>
<div class="content"><p>Ben Pace has a new post up on LessWrong that&#39;s asking about good exercises for rationality / general LW-adjacent stuff. I think this is a good thing to put up a bounty for, and I started thinking about what makes a good exercise. Exercises are good because they help you further the develop the material; they give you opportunities to put whatever relevant skill to use.</p>

<p>There are differing levels of what you can be trying to assess:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identifying the correct idea from a group of different ones</li>
<li>Summarizing the correct idea</li>
<li>Transferring the idea to someone else</li>
<li>Actually demonstrating whatever skill it is (if it&#39;s something you can do)</li>
<li>Actually using the skill to deduce something else (if it&#39;s a model thing)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think there&#39;s a good set of stuff to dive into here about the distinction between optimizing for pedagogy versus effectiveness. In the most stark case, you want to teach people using <em>less</em> potent versions of something, at least at first. Think not just training wheels on a bike, but successively more advanced models for physics or arithmetic. There&#39;s a gradual shift happening.</p>

<p>More than that, I wonder if the two angles are greatly  orthogonal. </p>

<p>Anyway, back to the original idea at hand. When you give people exercises, there&#39;s a sense of broad vs narrow that seems important, but I&#39;m still teasing it out. In one sense, you can think of tests that do multiple choice vs open-ended answers. But it&#39;s not like multiple-choice questions have to suck. You could give people very plausible-sounding answers which require them to do a lot of work to determine which one is correct. Similarly, open-ended questions could allow for bullshitting.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not exactly the format, but what sort of work it induces. </p>

<p>At the very least, it&#39;s about pushing for more Generative content. But beyond that, it gets into pedagogy questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can you give questions which increase in difficulty?

<ol>
<li>What does difficulty correspond to? If something is &quot;hard to figure out&quot;, what is that quality referring to? </li>
</ol></li>
<li>If you give open-ended questions, how can you assess the answers you get?</li>
<li>How much of this is covered already by the teaching literature?</li>
</ol>
