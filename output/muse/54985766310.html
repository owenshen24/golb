<div class="content"><p>I think that if I were to go back in time and give my freshman college self some good advice, it&#39;d be &quot;work on what you really want&quot;. I am still interested in machine learning things, and I was interested in machine learning things when I was a freshman. I think fighting harder for more opportunities would have helped me. Maybe. I think I did a good job of that in a few cases.</p>

<p>But too often there was some sort of implied hoop jumping. Something about needing to do boring stuff first so that I could be better positioned to do the exciting stuff. Except <em>everything snowballs</em>. So when you take on work that you don&#39;t like in order to get better at the stuff you <em>do</em> like, you also risk becoming more of (and known as) the sort of person who does the first thing, the thing you don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>I think college classes enforce this mindset at least mildly because there is a set of prereqs for each class. But especially with internships and things outside of school, I feel like there were more imagined hoops to jump through then there actually were. Related to all this is stuff about assertiveness / saying what you want, which I guess I still have difficulty with. So I&#39;d probably tell my younger self that no one was probably gonna yell at them for asking for work they found interesting.</p>

<p>Worst case, you just do the boring thing in order to gain more experience and resources. But before that, it seems to pay quite a bit to be more firm about actually working on things you&#39;re excited by.</p>
