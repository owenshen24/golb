<div class="content"><p>I think I&#39;ve been jumping the gun too quickly when it comes to &quot;helping people figure things out&quot;. To reiterate: it&#39;s much better to have people figure things out for themselves, rather than telling them. I think I&#39;ve been rather aggressively telling people things, rather than letting them make mistakes. Mostly in the context of board games, where I try to figure out what&#39;s optimal for them, and then helpfully tell them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably not actually very helpful. Also, takes away from the fun. Something about how it&#39;s good to let other people make mistakes they can afford to make.</p>

<p>But also, more board-game-specifically: when I&#39;m showing other players a new game, how well should I play? It doesn&#39;t seem very conducive to the other person&#39;s experience if I try Very Hard To Win. And it seems good to let the other person get a feel for the game first.</p>

<p>This seems harder in games where I can&#39;t just &quot;play a weaker deck&quot;, or whatever the analogue is. </p>
