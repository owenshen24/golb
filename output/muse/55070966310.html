<div class="content"><p>I think I missed the memo on this, but apparently 2x2 squares have been the sexy thing to do when talking about concepts for a while now, re: Ribbonfarm? Anyway, I&#39;ve been trying to square some thoughts about how it feels to do a task, and it seems like a 2x2 is the right way to go about it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the image:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5Si2erk.png" alt="2x2 square of attention/effort, low and high" width="400"></p>

<p>Now, I&#39;ll explain. I think about a task in terms of how difficult it is to <em>start</em> and how difficult it is to <em>maintain</em>. </p>

<p>Tasks with low effort are easy to start, you can think of them as things you don&#39;t have a lot of resistance to start. High effort tasks, for some reason or another, are aversive to start. They might be outcompeted by other, more attractive options, or maybe you&#39;ve got some internal conflict to resolve.</p>

<p>Tasks with low attention are ones where it is easy to keep going. This typically corresponds to a flow-like state. Your attention is occupied by the task. High attention tasks are ones where you constantly jump out of the moment.</p>

<p>What is this model useful for? I don&#39;t know...for now. I&#39;m happy that it provides another perspective on the same idea I was trying to gesture at in Attractor Theory, but in a cleaner way, though. </p>
