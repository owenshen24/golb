<div class="content"><p>Hey, yo, so I&#39;m back to writing stuff for now. Or, sort of. I mentioned that I&#39;d be taking a break for about three to four months. And now I&#39;m back. I think that using Muse as a sort of thing for now is okay. </p>

<p>So what have I been up to in the interim? 
- Well, I tried living without thinking too much about searching for insights. And, that didn&#39;t work out that well. 
- I finally revamped mindlevelup, and I&#39;m excited to be rolling out updated posts on the new site, but that isn&#39;t ready yet, and I&#39;m also a little slow on updating old posts. If you&#39;re curious, though, here&#39;s the <a href="mindlevelup.surge.sh">current link</a> (no guarantees it&#39;ll keep working later on).
- Working on a neural net implementation in Python. I&#39;m feeling a lot more comfortable with the bare-bones implementation. Next is maybe looking into implementing an automatic differentiation library.</p>

<p>What have I been thinking about? Well, in the times that I <em>have</em> been thinking, I&#39;ve been thinking about a lot of the same stuff:
- Meditating on the medium, competing alternatives. The single greatest impediment to productivity in the modern world is the introduction of entertainment superstimuli. Almost everything around is a Skinner box.
- Striving for some sort of minimalist aesthetic. Having less to worry about, less to carry around, etc. gives you more space to apply to other things.
- There are more instances to act than social rules dictate. Awkwardness and double-tracking aren&#39;t as limiting as they seem.</p>

<p>Now, I feel like it&#39;s less about finding a time to write, and it&#39;s more about having stuff worth writing about. Of course, having the time to do it is important, but it seems like that searhc process doesn&#39;t even happen unless you want to do it in the first place.</p>

<p>(Shocker, you can only do the thing you want to do. Yes, we&#39;ve gone Full Circle many, many times. Doesn&#39;t stop these insights from being useful, as it seems that, given that humans are leaky systems, we&#39;re not particularly great at holding onto everything. Even if growth is a coherent concept, it isn&#39;t contradictory to have a model where we&#39;re in a constant state of atrophy and loss. Although, oof, that ain&#39;t a great aesthetic.)</p>
