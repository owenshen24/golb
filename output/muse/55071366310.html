<div class="post-title">Calibrating With Cards</div>
<div class="date">Last Updated: 2019-08-08 18:04</div>
<div class="content"><p>In this post, I&#39;ll try to bring together two things I enjoy: rationality and magic. Like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ctBCPaD3yYimEHXPu/magic-is-dead-give-me-attention">Hazard</a>, I&#39;ve also practiced close-up magic for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfmIY5RG8gQ">good amount of time now</a>. After recently seeing Tyler Alterman make a Facebook post about estimations and System 1, it occurred to me that there are a few calibration exercises you can do with a deck of playing cards. The three exercises below are all variants of cutting/manipulating a deck of cards, and then trying to intuit something about the deck. </p>

<p>This serves three purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a feel for your System 1:

<ol>
<li>The goal of the following three exercises is to see how good your gut is at estimating uncertainty (hint: probably better than you think!)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Improve calibration:

<ol>
<li>These exercises all allow for some room for error. You can set your confidence intervals and see how quickly you can get calibrated using first principles.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Practice cool party tricks:

<ol>
<li>While I don&#39;t intend for this to be a full-on magic tutorial, the exercises I outline <em>are</em> building blocks for magic tricks, and even demonstrating your super-calibration (after getting good) might be impressive.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the three exercises:</p>

<h3>Cut Estimation</h3>

<p><img src="../images/cards-1.jpg" alt="cards being cut in half"></p>

<p>The simplest exercise is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lift up a packet of cards.</li>
<li>Estimate how many cards you&#39;ve picked up.</li>
<li>Count to check how many you actually picked up.</li>
</ol>

<p>You have a few obvious reference points. The entire deck is 52 cards, and you can easily tell if you&#39;ve lifted up more or less than half. With a little practice. I&#39;ve found that my gut is pretty good at this sort of thing. I&#39;ll ask myself how many cards, and there will be a number that feels right. It&#39;s usually quite close.</p>

<p>Things to pay attention to:</p>

<ul>
<li>When your System 2 estimate conflicts with your System 1 gut answer of how many cards you cut off.</li>
<li>Whether you are systematically over or underestimating the amount.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Repeating The Cut</h3>

<p><img src="../images/cards-2.jpg" alt="cutting to a specific card"></p>

<p>This is similar to the first one:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut to a card.</li>
<li>Replace the pack on the deck.</li>
<li>Cut to the same card again.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cutting to the same place twice is not easy, even with practice. </p>

<p>Things to pay attention to:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you try to cut to the card a second time, how quickly does your gut know that you got it right or wrong? </li>
<li>What does it feel like to &quot;know&quot; that the pack of cards in your hand is not the same size as the first time?</li>
<li>If you know you got it wrong, do you know if you cut too much or too little? And by how much?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Riffle Peek</h3>

<p>This one is something I&#39;ve just started playing with recently, and it&#39;s a mildly superhuman feat to get down right, if I say so myself.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cards-3.jpg" alt="riffling cards to find one card"></p>

<ol>
<li>Name a card. Any playing card.</li>
<li>Riffle through the cards, watching the corners (where the number and suits are) flip towards you, and look for the card you named.</li>
<li>Using the information in 2, cut to where you saw the card.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is <em>difficult</em>. It&#39;s partially an estimation task because you need to know approximately where through the deck you saw the card, i.e. half-way, at the end, etc. To start, you can go slow, such that you can see each card as it slips off your thumb. </p>

<p>This gets harder the faster you riffle through the cards. To ramp up the difficulty, riffle faster, such that you can only get a fractional peek at each card&#39;s corner. </p>

<p>Things to pay attention to:</p>

<ul>
<li>How does your visual experience of watching the cards differ when you <em>aren&#39;t</em> looking for a particular card vs when you are? Does anything jump out at you? Are there false positives?</li>
<li>How many riffles through the deck does it take for you to glimpse the card? (I don&#39;t always see it on the first pass through the deck myself.) </li>
<li>What is the visual experience of trying to differentiate between two similar cards (e.g. Ace of Hearts vs Ace of Diamonds)?</li>
</ul>

<p>I make no claims about these exercises leading to any majorly improved skills in any other area. But I do think they are a fun learning experience and a way to check in with your gut feelings through a medium many people may not have tried before. If you do decide to give it a go, let me know how it turns out!</p>
