<div class="content"><p>It feels like there&#39;s been a push towards getting people to start creating their own content. Platforms like YouTube + the Internet make it a lot easier for people to start.</p>

<p>Growing an audience, though, seems hard because there&#39;s not often a lot of free attention. Most of the competition is zero-sum between different content. People only have so much free time, so minutes they spend engaging with your stuff is minutes they don&#39;t spend engaging in other people&#39;s stuff.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a cynical viewpoint here which is something like &quot;If you don&#39;t think you&#39;re creating Good Content, don&#39;t broadcast it! We have enough low-quality stuff as it is, out there.&quot;</p>

<p>I think people often want to create, though. It&#39;s one of the default responses people have if you ask them &quot;Say you could live comfortably without needing to work. What would you do then?&quot; </p>

<p>Often, though, implementation takes far more time than coming up with the initial idea. There is an asymmetry across many fields where the actual ideation is done by only a small group of people. This then requires maybe 10X as many people to actually put into practice.</p>

<p>Thus, if you want people to join <em>your</em> project (which is of course great because you came up with it), you&#39;ll need to convince other people to go with you. On the flip side, I think there&#39;s a skill worth practicing where you let go of idea ownership. Stuff is going to get done, and you&#39;re going to be doing it; whoever came up with the idea might be less important than whether or not you want the stuff to happen.</p>

<p>But maybe the desire for individual ideation points to something important. A <em>really</em> large amount of people seem to want to partake in creative endeavors.</p>
