<div class="post-title">Critiquing Schoolwork</div>
<div class="content"><p>I&#39;m taking some classes this quarter, and they are all sort of okay. What I&#39;m annoyed by is how much better the assignments and lectures could be. Being the critical / prone-to-optimizing person that I am, I notice the ways that I think exercises / lectures could be better. &quot;If <em>I</em> were teaching, I&#39;d do it <em>this</em> way,&quot; is a common thought I have.</p>

<p>What makes all of this annoying is that I&#39;m finding it harder and harder to justify doing some of the school work assigned to me when I could imagine spending it on something better, from a pedagogical standpoint. One part of this is the whole, &quot;Once you&#39;re <em>told</em> to do something, it feels much less intrinsically motivating than if you want to do it for yourself.&quot; As a rule, this has been very true in describing my motivation. The other part, though, is that there <em>are</em> times when I&#39;m happy to commit to school work, but it has to make a convincing case to be worth my while.</p>

<p>And that doesn&#39;t seem to be happening. (Pent-up frustration goes here.)</p>

<p>I know that the people teaching <em>are</em> making pedagogical trade-offs. There is effort being put into the choices they make. I&#39;d just like for them to be clearer. Arguably the meta behind the process isn&#39;t needed for the object-level class--if you&#39;re just showing up to be taught. But I&#39;m picky.</p>

<p>One thing that&#39;s a common thread here is that this happens for subjects I know at least a little about. That seems like a prerequisite for me to have strong opinions. (Obvious, but still pointing it out.) </p>

<p>What are the things which make an assignment worthwhile for me? Some scattered thoughts lie below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Proving things. For technical courses, this often gives better justification for why things are the case.</li>
<li>Doing a practical problem on real-world data, or the like. This feels good because it brings up skills that are transferable to my own projects.</li>
<li>&quot;Novel&quot; approaches to problems, putting a new spin on things.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m not going particularly out of my way to justify any of this. Just taking note of some things that have been on my mind lately.</p>
