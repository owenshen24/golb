<div class="post-title">Experience Is Compounding</div>

<div class="content"><p>I&#8217;ve been on a real not-learning kick lately. By that, I mean a long stretch of not feeling like I&#8217;ve changed much as a person. See also <a href="https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/learning-from-past-experiences/">Learning from Past Experiences</a> and <a href="https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2018/01/27/replace-stereotypes-with-experiences/">Replace Stereotypes with Experiences</a>. I think I&#8217;ve stagnated a lot post-discovering-rationality, in that I haven&#8217;t had lots of recent experiences play into informing how I make decisions or into changing my self-concept. (It might not actually be that way. It just feels that way.)</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<ul>
<li>I haven&#8217;t really figured out how to feel like a college student.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve updated most of my models about marketing / companies after interning at Google.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m the sort of person who dates even after actually dating.</li>
</ul>

<p>The real question is something like &#8220;A bunch of cool stuff seems to be happening in the present. So why can&#8217;t I move faster and let these things in? Why do I feel stuck by past things?&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer is that experience compounds. One reason childhood events can be so influential isn&#8217;t just that they happened when you were at a formative time and developing your models. In addition, the fact that you pick them up early means they&#8217;ve had the privilege of being part of your thought processes for longer. They&#8217;re more well-worn tools.</p>

<p>Then, there&#8217;s also the default answer that each additional year of your life is, relative to the amount of years you&#8217;ve lived, a lesser amount. EX: From year 6 to 7, you&#8217;ve gained an extra ~15% of your total lifespan in new experiences. Whereas from 26 to 27, you&#8217;ve gained closer to 4% of your total lifespan in new experiences.</p>

<p>But, I&#8217;d like every year to be measured more equally with one another. I feel like cool stuff is passing by me right now, and I&#8217;m just slow on the uptake. I&#8217;m not taking it in!</p>

<p>Yes, you can get set in your older ways of thinking, and you will have seen more with each successive year. But <em>experientially speaking</em>  I&#8217;d like to get my brain to also pay more attention to the recent stuff.</p>

<p>I guess on hacky way to do this would be to spend more time ruminating on the present (which is also harder because if you&#8217;ve lived for 30 years, then by the same proportionality argument, there&#8217;s just less stuff to think about if you restrict yourself to years 29-30).</p>
