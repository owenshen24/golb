<div class="post-title">Happiness and Meaningness</div>
<div class="content"><p>I used to think that happiness was pretty important. Now, though, it looks like I didn&#39;t do a good job of figuring out exactly what &#39;happiness&#39; was about. (Yes, I know, Philosophy 101. Spare me, though, pretty please?)</p>

<p>SquirrelInHell has a good post about how happiness isn&#39;t <a href="https://squirrelinhell.blogspot.com/2017/12/happiness-is-chore.html">even what people really want</a>, and I think I&#39;m now more inclined to agree. It&#39;s not the wireheading thing; rather, it seems like sometimes I don&#39;t really...find myself inclined to seek out happiness in and of itself? But, also, yes, the wireheading thing.</p>

<p>So, as an alternative, there&#39;s been a whole bunch of buzz lately about this cool &#39;meaning&#39; thing. Some things have more &#39;weight&#39; than others. This quality affects how we recollect memories (is it the meaningful or the happy moments that are indelible?) and what we chase after. </p>

<p>Narrative, for all that it acts like crack for the human soul, is, um, important because it acts like crack for the human soul. There&#39;s something captivating about these cycles of conflict, loss, ascension, and acceptance. I had a recent conversation with a friend about how some of his most enjoyable activities were ones where only brief respites of triumph and happiness surged amidst a sea of contemplation and struggle.</p>

<p>(There&#39;s the immediate pattern-match to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aSQy7yHj6nPD44RNo/how-to-seem-and-be-deep">getting hit on a head with a truncheon here</a>, but stay with me here.)</p>

<p>It might seem that, given the relative nature of our brains, having some amount of loss is important to better feel the highs. But that&#39;s also not exactly it! It&#39;s like I would seek out conflict and problems as a fun activity, in and of itself. There&#39;s something about surmounting challenges that&#39;s just...how it is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more like...what do you even want?</p>

<ol>
<li>You could do things to be happy. </li>
<li>But then people complain about not doing something meaningful.</li>
<li>You could do something meaningful. But the Mission can fade, and in time you&#39;re back to feeling unsatisfied.</li>
<li>Do you cycle back to 1 to preserve your ego? </li>
<li>Is it treadmills all the way down?</li>
<li>These are all just abstractions over the Actual Human Thing, which is messy. Any model here seems like it&#39;d be descriptive at best. (&quot;If there was an answer to this question, what would it look like?&quot; is a recent favorite question of mine to ask.)</li>
</ol>
