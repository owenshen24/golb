<div class="post-title">Morning Page</div>
<div class="content"><p>Mornings Pages were this thing I used to do. I feel like my mornings have been significantly out of whack, so I&#39;d like to get more into a habit of doing them. When I make up in the mornings...it feels like there&#39;s not a lot of easy reinforcement. Some of that might be because our apartment has, I suspect, a paucity of &quot;good air&quot; (so it&#39;s not scientific, doesn&#39;t invalidate my internal experience) or something. Yeah. So I got some finals coming up. I used to think that exams were stupid; so how did I find myself studying for them? Well, I guess part of that is because I haven&#39;t been good enough to not study. Sigh. </p>

<p>And there&#39;s the thing where I start doing something, and then halfway through, I wonder if it&#39;s worthwhile after all. In general, the correct action in these cases is to commit to <em>not</em> thinking for a bit. Power through, and then evaluate. But evaluating at every instance isn&#39;t going to be useful.</p>

<p>I&#39;m heading home next week. That&#39;s pretty nice. Typing feels okay, and I&#39;m still worried about bad habits. In general, it seems like trying to figure all of this stuff out is...huh, notices I&#39;ve been a little less coherent. Putting in mental effort into this is the correct thing to do, though. Or something like that.</p>

<p>{Cue Q&amp;A:}</p>

<p>Q: How do I make mornings feel less like a sluggish spiral towards something good?</p>

<p>A: Cultivate more of a sense of excitement around the things I&#39;m doing.</p>

<p>Q: How do I do that?</p>

<p>A: Find things that feel good to do.</p>

<p>Q: Okay, but then how do I propagate the feeling of the actual
 experience rather than the feelings of <em>thinking about the experience</em>?
A: Ummm, remember to do so?</p>

<p>Q: Are you sure that&#39;s what&#39;s going on here?</p>

<p>A: Well, yeah. I have these habits. Stuff I do gives me reinforcement--</p>

<p>Q: And isn&#39;t that the more important thing? That there&#39;s reinforcement involved?</p>

<p>A: I...guess? If that&#39;s the case, then I&#39;ll need to acknowledge that some parts of me are getting some benefit out of this.</p>

<p>Q: And are you?</p>

<p>A: It certainly doesn&#39;t feel bad. But it&#39;s also detracting from the other thing I have going on.</p>

<p>Q: What is it about the other things that feels like they&#39;re being outcompeted?</p>

<p>A: I...don&#39;t really want to do them? Or, when faced with other options, it&#39;s way easier to play some more Pokemon Showdown or something.</p>

<p>Q: So it&#39;s easier.</p>

<p>A: But it&#39;s not like that! It&#39;s different. Plus, it&#39;s super annoying because I at least used to be in a position where I felt more driven to do the other things.</p>

<p>Q: Environmental cues much?</p>

<p>A: Well, at least it&#39;ll be over soon then, seeing as I&#39;m moving out. But, yeah. Something about finding ways to ground/center myself more. I think the obvious move of leaving my apartment is probably still one of the best moves.</p>
