<div class="content"><p>Two concepts:</p>

<p>Stockholm Syndrome:</p>

<ul>
<li>A bunch of classes / requirements are probably only perpetuated because of Stockholm-Syndrome-esque reasons, where people think &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s obviously good because I was required to do it.&#8221;</li>
<li>Also, maybe spite, ala &#8220;If I went through a bad experience, so should others!&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>There&#8217;s a more complicated way to point to this phenomenon that&#8217;s about rationalization and tradition, but given that Stockholm Syndrome is more well-known, co-opting it might make more sense for explaining it to others.</p>

<p>No one seems to understand how causal mechanisms are supposed to work, and there&#8217;s cargo culting all the way down:</p>

<ul>
<li>Schools requiring students to meet the identifiers of a great essay (e.g. having at least 3 citations) will not produce great essays.</li>
<li>Marketing ploys which use athletes to promote their health product. Just because Alice is successful and uses Product X doesn&#8217;t mean using Product X will make you successful as well.</li>
</ul>
