<div class="content"><p>(A lot of ink has been shed on the topic of how to rationally update your beliefs with respect to other sources. I don&#8217;t mean for this little essay to contribute to the overall discussion. It&#8217;s just something that I realized, on a more gut-level, recently.)</p>

<p>I have a lot of friends who I think are smart. They sometimes tell me things. And because they&#8217;re smart, I tend to take what they say rather seriously. More seriously than, say, if I were to read something on my own which claimed the same thing. But, what if my smart friend just offhandedly said something? It seems that I still take them rather seriously, especially if I don&#8217;t know that they&#8217;re being offhanded about it. </p>

<p>I mean, obviously, it&#8217;s good to report your credences and all that, but that sort of normative behavior happens less than you&#8217;d think. Anyway, the point here is that I seem to assign greater confidence to people I know compared to sources I read.</p>

<p>So what really happens is something like Alice tells me, &#8220;You know, Owen, I heard that X.&#8221; And I&#8217;ll take that as rather strong evidence for X. Except that, if I assume Alice generally reads the same stuff as I do, then her claim for X is really means something like &#8220;I read some stuff which convinced me of X&#8221;. Which just ends up being a claim about the existence of evidence for X. But if Alice isn&#8217;t thinking too hard about all this and sometimes just passes on stuff she&#8217;s reading to me, then I might be unduly weighting these claims, i.e. more than if I had just seen the evidence myself.</p>

<p>The obvious recourse here is to ask people for their sources when they claim stuff. More generally, when people tell me X, it&#8217;s not really some &#8220;other&#8221; more trustworthy source. I think I should just infer the existence of evidence for X which my friend saw. The glaring exception here is if my friends are incorporating several sources of information; in which case, they would have stronger evidence for X. </p>

<p>And, honestly, they probably do this for the most part. It&#8217;s the edge cases I&#8217;m worried about.</p>

<p>Social evidence is very compelling. One might wonder, &#8220;Why do I by default assign higher credences to claims made by people I know?&#8221; The rational explanation is that if I know my friends have good epistemic hygiene, then I can place high confidence in what they tell me. But of course that&#8217;s probably not it. People generally back up their friends and trust them, even in cases where their friends have questoinable epistemics.</p>

<p>Like just about everything in life, there&#8217;s a plausible evo-psych argument that talks about group cohesion, alliances, and coalitions.</p>
