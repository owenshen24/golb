<div class="content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I have written in my journal. This is quite odd, actually, as I have previously written in journals daily for 4-ish years. So that&#8217;s been a habit I haven&#8217;t been doing. I think that, on the whole, I have gotten less benefit out of it, but I&#8217;m not sure which way the causation flows.</p>

<p>I suppose I want to keep doing it, if only because keeping a journal also feels like a continuation of self. Otherwise, it feels like parts my life just slip through without any real mark that they&#8217;ve happened.</p>
