        <div class="content"><p>Everyone kinda knows that some mixture of love and affection doesn't cut it in relationships. I've been reading Attached on attachment theory. (Yes, I'm late.) Anyway, in the same way that Double Crux seems to work because, by acknowledging each side's most "strongly-felt" arguments, you signal to the other person "Yes, I see you, and you exist / have valid points."</p>

<p>Some scattered words:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Affirmation</li>
<li>Acknowledgment</li>
<li>Appreciation</li>
</ul>

<p>These all seem like some of the "boring" (but they're really not!) undercurrents of good relationships, ala attachment theory. I don't think I thought in this way of affirmations previously.</p>
