<div class="content"><p>There&#8217;s this weird thing that&#8217;s been happening lately where I generally feel okay, and I&#8217;m noting that my state of mind is &#8220;y&#8217;know, pretty good&#8221;. And I&#8217;m being mindful of that.</p>

<p>The issue arises when I am thinking about what to do next. Some part of me will think &#8220;Oh, hey, there&#8217;s this cool problem that&#8217;s been bugging us that we could dive int&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon the rest of my brain will think &#8220;No! Don&#8217;t dive in! If you do, then you&#8217;ll start to think about painful things, and you&#8217;ll lose your current state of mind (which is not dwelling on painful stuff).&#8221;</p>

<p>I think this might just be a not-helpful defense mechanism. Not looking into the bad bits doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not there. While it seems good to be strategic about choosing when to dive into examining different problems, I think my current policy lately has been something like a blanket &#8220;No, just don&#8217;t do it!&#8221;, which seems bad because then I just <em>never</em> end up addressing those issues.</p>
