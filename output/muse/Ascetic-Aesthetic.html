<div class="content"><p>I have a Mood or a Feel that I care a lot about. It&#8217;s a little like minimalism. It&#8217;s a little like praising deprivation. It&#8217;s a little like mindfulness. I think that there is a lot to be mindful of in the space of doing things like being hungry / sore / lustful. In general, these are states where you have a feel of Wanting.</p>

<p>I think peering into this space of things is interesting, although I realize I haven&#8217;t quite articulated why. Some other actions which also seem to fit this pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoiding video games / TV shows / general attention-commandeering activities.</li>
<li>Taking more appreciation in very mundane activities like staring at a wall, going for a walk, or lying on the ground.</li>
<li>Eating bland foods, staying in the cold, abstaining from sexual things.</li>
</ul>

<p>One explanation that sort of fits this Aesthetic is that I&#8217;m trying to find ways to renormalize my standards when it comes to rewards and reinforcement. In this way, if I&#8217;m finding even bland things exciting, then it&#8217;s a lot easier to do productive things because most things in life tend to be better than bland things.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t feel like that from the inside, though. It just feels like a Good thing to do, in the same way that helping people or other Virtuous things feel good.</p>

<p>Tangential: There&#8217;s a thread here about what sorts of things I consider when making decisions. As in, what are the relevant factors? I don&#8217;t do a straight-up util calculation, and it&#8217;s not clear that I&#8217;m doing any naive consequentialism reasoning either.</p>

<p>Rather, there&#8217;s a lot happening, from self-signaling, to chaining actions, etc. etc.</p>
