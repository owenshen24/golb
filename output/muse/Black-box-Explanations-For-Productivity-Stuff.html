      <div class="content"><p>You know how sometimes you're staring at a problem or a math proof, and you know that you <em>could</em> find the solution? But maybe you don't go all the way and actually explicate the solution. There's just the feeling of <em>existence</em> that's present.</p>

As in, there's effort I could put in to "translate" whatever technique I'm using into a more Standard Ontology which makes it sound Reasonable. But sometimes, I just deal with existence proofs.</p>
