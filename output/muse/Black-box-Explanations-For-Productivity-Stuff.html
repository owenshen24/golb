<div class="content"><p>You know how sometimes you&#8217;re staring at a problem or a math proof, and you know that you <em>could</em> find the solution? But maybe you don&#8217;t go all the way and actually explicate the solution. There&#8217;s just the feeling of <em>existence</em> that&#8217;s present.</p>

<p>I often feel a similar black-box-y feel when I&#8217;m thinking about justifying certain rationality techniques. As in, there&#8217;s effort I could put in to &#8220;translate&#8221; whatever technique I&#8217;m using into a more Standard Ontology which makes it sound Reasonable. But sometimes, I just deal with existence proofs.</p>
