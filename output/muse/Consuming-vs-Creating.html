<div class="content"><p>This is similar to my previous post on Consumers and Creators. Except this time, instead of thinking about roles that people play, I&#8217;m thinking about the acts involved in each one of the roles. When you&#8217;re Consuming, you&#8217;re taking something in. It&#8217;s a passive practice, like watching a movie or reading a book. Creating is about actively making something. Consuming takes less effort, so it&#8217;s the default. But the useful work comes from Creating. </p>

<p>What is the takeaway here?</p>

<ul>
<li>Taking note of when you&#8217;re doing one over the other.</li>
<li>Time doesn&#8217;t make itself. Being okay to decline opportunities to do X with other people, if it&#8217;s a Consuming-type activity.</li>
<li>Noting the parallels to active vs passive, acting vs reacting, recognizing vs generating, etc. etc.</li>
</ul>
