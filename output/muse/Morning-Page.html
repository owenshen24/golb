<div class="content"><p>Mornings Pages were this thing I used to do. I feel like my mornings have been significantly out of whack, so I&#8217;d like to get more into a habit of doing them. When I make up in the mornings&#8230;it feels like there&#8217;s not a lot of easy reinforcement. Some of that might be because our apartment has, I suspect, a paucity of &#8220;good air&#8221; (so it&#8217;s not scientific, doesn&#8217;t invalidate my internal experience) or something. Yeah. So I got some finals coming up. I used to think that exams were stupid; so how did I find myself studying for them? Well, I guess part of that is because I haven&#8217;t been good enough to not study. Sigh. </p>

<p>And there&#8217;s the thing where I start doing something, and then halfway through, I wonder if it&#8217;s worthwhile after all. In general, the correct action in these cases is to commit to <em>not</em> thinking for a bit. Power through, and then evaluate. But evaluating at every instance isn&#8217;t going to be useful.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m heading home next week. That&#8217;s pretty nice. Typing feels okay, and I&#8217;m still worried about bad habits. In general, it seems like trying to figure all of this stuff out is&#8230;huh, notices I&#8217;ve been a little less coherent. Putting in mental effort into this is the correct thing to do, though. Or something like that.</p>

<p>{Cue Q&amp;A:}</p>

<p>Q: How do I make mornings feel less like a sluggish spiral towards something good?</p>

<p>A: Cultivate more of a sense of excitement around the things I&#8217;m doing.</p>

<p>Q: How do I do that?</p>

<p>A: Find things that feel good to do.</p>

<p>Q: Okay, but then how do I propagate the feeling of the actual
 experience rather than the feelings of <em>thinking about the experience</em>?
A: Ummm, remember to do so?</p>

<p>Q: Are you sure that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on here?</p>

<p>A: Well, yeah. I have these habits. Stuff I do gives me reinforcement&#8211;</p>

<p>Q: And isn&#8217;t that the more important thing? That there&#8217;s reinforcement involved?</p>

<p>A: I&#8230;guess? If that&#8217;s the case, then I&#8217;ll need to acknowledge that some parts of me are getting some benefit out of this.</p>

<p>Q: And are you?</p>

<p>A: It certainly doesn&#8217;t feel bad. But it&#8217;s also detracting from the other thing I have going on.</p>

<p>Q: What is it about the other things that feels like they&#8217;re being outcompeted?</p>

<p>A: I&#8230;don&#8217;t really want to do them? Or, when faced with other options, it&#8217;s way easier to play some more Pokemon Showdown or something.</p>

<p>Q: So it&#8217;s easier.</p>

<p>A: But it&#8217;s not like that! It&#8217;s different. Plus, it&#8217;s super annoying because I at least used to be in a position where I felt more driven to do the other things.</p>

<p>Q: Environmental cues much?</p>

<p>A: Well, at least it&#8217;ll be over soon then, seeing as I&#8217;m moving out. But, yeah. Something about finding ways to ground/center myself more. I think the obvious move of leaving my apartment is probably still one of the best moves.</p>
