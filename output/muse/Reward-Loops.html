<div class="content"><p>Sometimes, when I&#8217;m on Facebook, I&#8217;ll get a notification. I&#8217;ll click on it, and then someone has sent me a message. I&#8217;ll respond to the message, and then I&#8217;ve got a new notification. This cycle repeats itself. (Usually it&#8217;s not this direct; maybe I go and respond to an email, then a text message shows up, and <em>then</em> I get a new notification.) The point here is that there&#8217;s some chain of reinforcement which catches me in a loop, repeating the same activities over and over.</p>

<p>Inside, though, it just feels like &#8220;Ooh, there&#8217;s this cool thing I can check out! Oh wow, now there&#8217;s this <em>other</em> new cool thing I can check out!&#8221;</p>

<p>This is probably just bad.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not the same thing, but I&#8217;m thinking about switching between tasks and the novelty they provide (more productive tasks, that is). Presumably there&#8217;s some optimal pattern of choosing activities such that you can also reduce any feeling of fatigue.</p>

<p>But also, activities where you command your attention also tend to be more demanding. You might finish them and feel more tired. I don&#8217;t know. Doing even normal attention-sucking things like watching TV or playing games also saturates really easily for me.</p>

<p>Maybe my general tolerance for doing the same thing is just lower than average.</p>
