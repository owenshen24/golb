<div class="content"><p>It&#8217;s now my second year of college. I suppose that Muse works more as a place for me to be far more casual about what&#8217;s been up with my life. I&#8217;m not sure if many people read this. But whatever, I&#8217;m using this as a way to catalogue some of my messier thoughts.</p>

<p>Since coming back to college, I feel like I&#8217;ve been swept up in a far more frantic flow. Around this time my first year, I wanted to take <em>all</em> the cool classes and learn <em>all</em> the exciting things. Now, though, it seems like, after a year, I haven&#8217;t exactly learned the virtue of Patience, but I&#8217;m okay being more&#8230;unfulfilled?</p>

<p>It no longer seems prudent to try and maximize all of the things or to take all of the classes. I think this is a little jarring. The pace of growing older seems so slow. Projects can take a while, and no one is ever in a rush to get things done.</p>

<p>At the risk of channeling the aesthetic of accelerating progress, acclimation, and fading novelty, I still think there is a Time and Place to be FAST.</p>

<p>There is something independent of the carelessness and hurry that accompanies the typical speediness. There is a more delibrate use of speed in the same way that focused attention does not discount the use of Blankness.</p>
